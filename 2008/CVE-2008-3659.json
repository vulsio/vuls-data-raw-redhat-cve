	},
	"details": [
		"Buffer overflow in the memnstr function in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP 5.6 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the delimiter argument to the explode function.  NOTE: the scope of this issue is limited since most applications would not use an attacker-controlled delimiter, but local attacks against safe_mode are feasible."

	"statement": "The PHP interpreter does not offer a reliable \"sandboxed\" security layer (as found in, say, a JVM) in which untrusted scripts can be run any script run by the PHP interpreter must be trusted with the privileges of the interpreter itself. We therefore do not classify this issue as security-sensitive since no trust boundary is crossed.",

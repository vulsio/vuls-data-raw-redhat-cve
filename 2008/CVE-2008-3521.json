	"details": [
		"Race condition in the jas_stream_tmpfile function in libjasper/base/jas_stream.c in JasPer 1.900.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (program exit) by creating the appropriate tmp.XXXXXXXXXX temporary file, which causes Jasper to exit. NOTE: this was originally reported as a symlink issue, but this was incorrect. NOTE: some vendors dispute the severity of this issue, but it satisfies CVE's requirements for inclusion."

		"id": "447884",

	},
	"cwe": "CWE-121",
	"details": [
		"Stack-based buffer overflow in the split_redraw function in split.c in mtr before 0.73, when invoked with the -p (aka --split) option, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS PTR record.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a vulnerability in the ns_name_ntop function in resolv/ns_name.c in glibc and the proper fix should be in glibc; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in mtr."
	],
	"statement": "This issue does not affect the versions of mtr as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5.\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 and 3, this issue can only be exploited if an attacker can convince victim to use mtr to trace path to or via the IP, for which an attacker controls PTR DNS records. Additionally, the victim must run mtr in \"split mode\" by providing -p or --split command line options. The Red Hat Product Security has therefore rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.",

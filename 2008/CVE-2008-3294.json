	"details": [
		"src/configure.in in Vim 5.0 through 7.1, when used for a build with Python support, does not ensure that the Makefile-conf temporary file has the intended ownership and permissions, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code by modifying this file during a time window, or by creating it ahead of time with permissions that prevent its modification by configure."

	"statement": "This issue can only be exploited during the package build and it does not affect users of pre-built packages distributed with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Therefore, we do not plan to backport a fix for this issue to already released version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5."

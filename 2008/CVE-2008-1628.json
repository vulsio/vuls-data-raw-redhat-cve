	"statement": "This issue did not affect the audit packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nRed Hat is not treating this issue as a security vulnerability for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as no application used the affected interface, and the only result is a controlled application termination as the overflow is detected by the FORTIFY_SOURCE protection mechanism. We plan to address this as non-security bug fix in updated audit packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.2.\nFor further details, please see:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2008-1628",

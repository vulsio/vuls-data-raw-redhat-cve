		"In /drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c: A user-controlled buffer is copied into a local buffer of constant size using strcpy without a length check which can cause a buffer overflow. This affects the Linux kernel 4.9-stable tree, 4.12-stable tree, 3.18-stable tree, and 4.4-stable tree.",
		"A buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's isdn_net_newslave() function in the /drivers/isdn/i4l/isdn_net.c file. An overflow happens when the user-controlled buffer is copied into a local buffer of constant size using strcpy() without a length check."

		"Heap-based buffer overflow in the S_regatom function in regcomp.c in Perl 5 before 5.24.3-RC1 and 5.26.x before 5.26.1-RC1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a regular expression with a '\\N{}' escape and the case-insensitive modifier.",
		"A heap write buffer overflow was found in perl's S_regatom() function, which is used in the compilation of regular expressions, resulting in the crash of the perl interpreter. An attacker, able to provide a specially crafted regular expression, could cause a denial of service."

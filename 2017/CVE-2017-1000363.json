	"details": [
		"Linux drivers/char/lp.c Out-of-Bounds Write. Due to a missing bounds check, and the fact that parport_ptr integer is static, a 'secure boot' kernel command line adversary (can happen due to bootloader vulns, e.g. Google Nexus 6's CVE-2016-10277, where due to a vulnerability the adversary has partial control over the command line) can overflow the parport_nr array in the following code, by appending many (>LP_NO) 'lp=none' arguments to the command line.",
		"A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's lp_setup() function where it doesn't apply any bounds checking when passing \"lp=none\".  This can result into overflow of the parport_nr[] array. An attacker with control over kernel command line can overwrite kernel code and data with fixed (0xff) values."

	"cwe": "CWE-73",
	"details": [
		"PECL in the download utility class in the Installer in PEAR Base System v1.10.1 does not validate file types and filenames after a redirect, which allows remote HTTP servers to overwrite files via crafted responses, as demonstrated by a .htaccess overwrite.",
		"A vulnerability was found in php-pear where if a malicious server responded to a pear"
	],
	"statement": "Since pear's purpose is to download libraries for inclusion in an application, any use of `pear install` or `pear download` implicitly trusts the server. This vulnerability does not significantly extend the trust already given to pear and to servers used with it.",

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "This vulnerability only allows files in the current directory to be overwritten, so using `pear download` in a temporary directory effectively mitigates the risk of a dangerous file overwrite occurring."

		"When Private Browsing mode is used, it is possible for a web worker to write persistent data to IndexedDB and fingerprint a user uniquely. IndexedDB should not be available in Private Browsing mode and this stored data will persist across multiple private browsing mode sessions because it is not cleared when exiting. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 52.5.2 and Firefox < 57.0.1.",

In Private Browsing mode, a web worker could write persistent data to IndexedDB, which was not cleared when exiting and would persist across multiple sessions. A malicious website could exploit the flaw to bypass private-browsing protections and uniquely fingerprint visitors."

		"An information leak flaw was found in the way SMB1 protocol was implemented by Samba before 4.4.16, 4.5.x before 4.5.14, and 4.6.x before 4.6.8. A malicious client could use this flaw to dump server memory contents to a file on the samba share or to a shared printer, though the exact area of server memory cannot be controlled by the attacker.",

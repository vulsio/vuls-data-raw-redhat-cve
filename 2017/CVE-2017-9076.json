	"details": [
		"The dccp_v6_request_recv_sock function in net/dccp/ipv6.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.1 mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to CVE-2017-8890.",
		"The IPv6 DCCP implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles inheritance, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, a related issue to CVE-2017-8890. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although we believe it is unlikely."

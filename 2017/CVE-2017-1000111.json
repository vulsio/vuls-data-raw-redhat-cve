	"details": [
		"Linux kernel: heap out-of-bounds in AF_PACKET sockets. This new issue is analogous to previously disclosed CVE-2016-8655. In both cases, a socket option that changes socket state may race with safety checks in packet_set_ring. Previously with PACKET_VERSION. This time with PACKET_RESERVE. The solution is similar: lock the socket for the update. This issue may be exploitable, we did not investigate further. As this issue affects PF_PACKET sockets, it requires CAP_NET_RAW in the process namespace. But note that with user namespaces enabled, any process can create a namespace in which it has CAP_NET_RAW.",
		"A race condition issue was found in the way the raw packet socket implementation in the Linux kernel networking subsystem handled synchronization. A local user able to open a raw packet socket (requires the CAP_NET_RAW capability) could use this to waste resources in the kernel's ring buffer or possibly cause an out-of-bounds read on the heap leading to a system crash."

	"details": [
		"Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) that supports IEEE 802.11r allows reinstallation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) Temporal Key (TK) during the fast BSS transmission (FT) handshake, allowing an attacker within radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames.",
		"A new exploitation technique called key reinstallation attacks (KRACK) affecting WPA2 has been discovered. A remote attacker within Wi-Fi range could exploit this attack to decrypt Wi-Fi traffic or possibly inject forged Wi-Fi packets by reinstalling a previously used pairwise key (PTK-TK) by retransmitting Fast BSS Transition (FT) Reassociation Requests."

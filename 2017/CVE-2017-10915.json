		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "Where the HVM guest is explicitly configured to use shadow paging (eg\nvia the `hap=0' xl domain configuration file parameter), changing to\nHAP (eg by setting `hap=1') will avoid exposing the vulnerability to\nthose guests.  HAP is the default (in upstream Xen), where the\nhardware supports it; so this mitigation is only applicable if HAP has\nbeen disabled by configuration.\n(This mitigation is not applicable to PV guests.)"

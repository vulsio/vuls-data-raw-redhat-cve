	"details": [
		"KDE kmail before 5.5.2 and messagelib before 5.5.2, as distributed in KDE Applications before 17.04.2, do not ensure that a plugin's sign/encrypt action occurs during use of the Send Later feature, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.",
		"It was found that KMail's Send Later with Delay function bypassed OpenPGP signing and encryption, causing the message to be sent unsigned and in plain-text. A remote attacker, with access to the user's network traffic, could potentially use this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the plain-text email messages."

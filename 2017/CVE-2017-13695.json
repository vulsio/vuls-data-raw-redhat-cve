		"The acpi_ns_evaluate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nseval.c in the Linux kernel through 4.12.9 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.",
		"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's ACPI subsystem where a function does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump.  This allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism when using a specially crafted ACPI table."

	"details": [
		"By exploiting the way Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.4 renders embedded objects, an attacker could craft a document that allows reading in a file from the user's filesystem. Information could be retrieved by the attacker by, e.g., using hidden sections to store the information, tricking the user into saving the document and convincing the user to send the document back to the attacker. The vulnerability is mitigated by the need for the attacker to know the precise file path in the target system, and the need to trick the user into saving the document and sending it back.",
		"It was found that LibreOffice disclosed contents of a file specified in an embedded object's preview. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to expose details of a system running LibreOffice as an online service via a crafted document."

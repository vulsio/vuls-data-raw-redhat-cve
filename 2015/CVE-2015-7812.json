		"The hypercall_create_continuation function in arch/arm/domain.c in Xen 4.4.x through 4.6.x allows local guest users to cause a denial of service (host crash) via a preemptible hypercall to the multicall interface."
	],
	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than guest administrator, running only kernels which do not make use of multicall functionality will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this issue. However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into the kernel (e.g. by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege."

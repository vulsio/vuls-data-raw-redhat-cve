		"The keyctl_read_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.4 does not properly use a semaphore, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that leverages a race condition between keyctl_revoke and keyctl_read calls.",
		"A NULL-pointer dereference flaw was found in the kernel, which is caused by a race between revoking a user-type key and reading from it. The issue could be triggered by an unprivileged user with a local account, causing the kernel to crash (denial of service)."

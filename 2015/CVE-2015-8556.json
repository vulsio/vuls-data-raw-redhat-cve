		"Local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Gentoo QEMU package before 2.5.0-r1.",
		"A Time of Creation To Time of Usage (TOCTTOU) flaw was discovered in the QEMU emulator built with VirtFS(file system pass-through) support to share folders between host and guest. The flaw occurs if the 'virtfs-proxy-helper' program is installed with SUID permissions or has 'CAP_CHOWN' capability.  An unprivileged, local attacker could exploit this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges and gain root access to the system."

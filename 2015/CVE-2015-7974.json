		"NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90 do not verify peer associations of symmetric keys when authenticating packets, which might allow remote attackers to conduct impersonation attacks via an arbitrary trusted key, aka a \"skeleton key.\"",
		"A flaw was found in the way NTP verified trusted keys during symmetric key authentication. An authenticated client (A) could use this flaw to modify a packet sent between a server (B) and a client (C) using a key that is different from the one known to the client (A)."

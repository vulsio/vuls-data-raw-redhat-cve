		"daemon/abrt-handle-upload.in in Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT), when moving problem reports from /var/spool/abrt-upload, allows local users to write to arbitrary files or possibly have other unspecified impact via a symlink attack on (1) /var/spool/abrt or (2) /var/tmp/abrt.",
		"It was discovered that, when moving problem reports between certain directories, abrt-handle-upload did not verify that the new problem directory had appropriate permissions and did not contain symbolic links. An attacker able to create a crafted problem report could use this flaw to expose other parts of ABRT, or to overwrite arbitrary files on the system."

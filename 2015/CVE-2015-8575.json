	"details": [
		"The sco_sock_bind function in net/bluetooth/sco.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3.4 does not verify an address length, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application.",
		"An out-of-bounds flaw was found in the kernel, where the sco_sock_bind() function (bluetooth/sco) did not check the length of its sockaddr parameter. As a result, more kernel memory was copied out than required, leaking information from the kernel stack (including kernel addresses). A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass kernel ASLR or leak other information."

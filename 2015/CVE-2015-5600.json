	"cwe": "CWE-304",
	"details": [
		"The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.",
		"It was discovered that the OpenSSH sshd daemon did not check the list of keyboard-interactive authentication methods for duplicates. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass the MaxAuthTries limit, making it easier to perform password guessing attacks."

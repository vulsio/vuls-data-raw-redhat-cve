		"The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0.3 does not initialize a certain list data structure during an unhash operation, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) by leveraging the ability to make a SOCK_DGRAM socket system call for the IPPROTO_ICMP or IPPROTO_ICMPV6 protocol, and then making a connect system call after a disconnect.",
		"It was found that the Linux kernel's ping socket implementation did not properly handle socket unhashing during spurious disconnects, which could lead to a use-after-free flaw. On x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to crash the system. On non-x86-64 architecture systems, a local user able to create ping sockets could use this flaw to escalate their privileges on the system."

Any other value means that the ping socket functionality might be enabled for certain users on the system.\nTo mitigate this vulnerability make sure that you either allow the functionality to trusted local users (groups) only or set the net.ipv4.ping_group_range sysctl to the default and disabled state:\n~]# sysctl net.ipv4.ping_group_range=\"1 0\"\nPlease note that this might prevent some programs relying on this functionality from functioning properly."

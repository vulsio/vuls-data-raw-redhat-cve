		"arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform does not properly determine when nested NMI processing is occurring, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (skipped NMI) by modifying the rsp register, issuing a syscall instruction, and triggering an NMI.",
		"It was found that if a Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) occurred immediately after a SYSCALL call or before a SYSRET call with the user RSP pointing to the NMI IST stack, the kernel could skip that NMI."

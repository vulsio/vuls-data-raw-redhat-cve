	"cwe": "CWE-212",
	"details": [
		"The get_bitmap_file function in drivers/md/md.c in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 does not initialize a certain bitmap data structure, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a GET_BITMAP_FILE ioctl call.",
		"A cross-boundary flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel software raid driver.  The driver accessed a disabled bitmap where only the first byte of the buffer was initialized to zero.  This meant that the rest of the request (up to 4095 bytes) was left and copied into user space. An attacker could use this flaw to read private information from user space that would not otherwise have been accessible."

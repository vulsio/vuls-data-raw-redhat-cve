		"The PortletRequestDispatcher in PortletBridge, as used in Red Hat JBoss Portal 6.2.0, does not properly enforce the security constraints of servlets, which allows remote attackers to gain access to resources via a request that asks to render a non-JSF resource.",
		"It was found that PortletBridge PortletRequestDispatcher did not respect security constraints set by the servlet if a portlet request asked for rendering of a non-JSF resource such as JSP or HTML. A remote attacker could use this flaw to potentially bypass certain security constraints and gain access to restricted resources."

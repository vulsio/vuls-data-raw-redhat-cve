	"cwe": "CWE-122",
	"details": [
		"The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.",
		"A heap-based buffer overflow flaw was found in glibc's swscanf() function. An attacker able to make an application call the swscanf() function could use this flaw to crash that application or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of glibc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did use different memory allocation algorithm in swscanf() function.",

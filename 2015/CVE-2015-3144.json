		"The fix_hostname function in cURL and libcurl 7.37.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a zero-length host name, as demonstrated by \"http://:80\" and \":80.\"",
		"It was discovered that libcurl did not properly process zero-length host names. If an attacker could trick an application using libcurl into processing zero-length host names, this could lead to an out-of-bounds read, and possibly cause that application to crash."

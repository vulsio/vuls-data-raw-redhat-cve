	"cwe": "CWE-295",
	"details": [
		"GnuTLS before 3.1.0 does not verify that the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm matches the signature algorithm in the certificate, which allows remote attackers to conduct downgrade attacks via unspecified vectors.",
		"It was found that GnuTLS did not verify whether a hashing algorithm listed in a signature matched the hashing algorithm listed in the certificate. An attacker could create a certificate that used a different hashing algorithm than it claimed, possibly causing GnuTLS to use an insecure, disallowed hashing algorithm during certificate verification."

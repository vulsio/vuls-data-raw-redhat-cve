	"details": [
		"The slapi-nis plug-in before 0.54.2 does not properly reallocate memory when processing user accounts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a request for a (1) group with a large number of members or (2) user that belongs to a large number of groups.",
		"It was discovered that the slapi-nis Directory Server plug-in did not correctly perform memory reallocation when handling user account information. A request for information about a group with many members, or a request for a user that belongs to a large number of groups, would cause a Directory Server to enter an infinite loop and consume an excessive amount of CPU time."

	"cwe": "CWE-122",
	"details": [
		"GNU GRUB (aka GRUB2) through 2.12 has a heap-based buffer overflow in fs/hfs.c via crafted sblock data in an HFS filesystem.",
		"A flaw was found in the HFS file system driver in grub2. This issue allows a local attacker to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted sblock in a malicious HFS file system, causing memory corruption, unexpected behavior, and denial of service."
	],
	"statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into running grub2 with a specially crafted HFS file system image, limiting the exposure of this flaw. For this reason, this vulnerability has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe grub2 package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, 8, 9 and in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 is not affected by this vulnerability because the HFS module is not built, so this issue is not applicable.",

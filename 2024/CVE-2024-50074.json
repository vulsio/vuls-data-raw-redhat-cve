		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nparport: Proper fix for array out-of-bounds access\nThe recent fix for array out-of-bounds accesses replaced sprintf()\ncalls blindly with snprintf().  However, since snprintf() returns the\nwould-be-printed size, not the actually output size, the length\ncalculation can still go over the given limit.\nUse scnprintf() instead of snprintf(), which returns the actually\noutput letters, for addressing the potential out-of-bounds access\nproperly.",
		"An out-of-bounds array access memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel. When snprintf() returns the would-be-printed size, not the actual output size, the length\ncalculation can still go over the given limit and cause an overflow, resulting in loss of availability of the system."

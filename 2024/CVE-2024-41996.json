	"cwe": "CWE-295",
	"details": [
		"Validating the order of the public keys in the Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol, when an approved safe prime is used, allows remote attackers (from the client side) to trigger unnecessarily expensive server-side DHE modular-exponentiation calculations. The client may cause asymmetric resource consumption. The basic attack scenario is that the client must claim that it can only communicate with DHE, and the server must be configured to allow DHE and validate the order of the public key."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability is classified as moderate severity rather than high because it requires specific conditions to be exploitable. The attack depends on the server being configured to use DHE key exchange and perform public key order validation, which is not the default in many configurations. Additionally, while the attack can cause increased CPU usage, leading to a potential denial of service, it does not directly compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the data being exchanged. The impact is limited to resource exhaustion, and mitigations such as rate limiting, alternative key exchange methods, or disabling DHE can effectively reduce the attack surface, making it less impacted than issues that could lead to direct data breaches or system compromise.",

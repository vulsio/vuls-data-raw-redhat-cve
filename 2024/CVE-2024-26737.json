		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nbpf: Fix racing between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free and bpf_timer_cancel\nThe following race is possible between bpf_timer_cancel_and_free\nand bpf_timer_cancel. It will lead a UAF on the timer->timer.\nbpf_timer_cancel();\nspin_lock();\nt = timer->time;\nspin_unlock();\nbpf_timer_cancel_and_free();\nspin_lock();\nt = timer->timer;\ntimer->timer = NULL;\nspin_unlock();\nhrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);\nkfree(t);\n/* UAF on t */\nhrtimer_cancel(&t->timer);\nIn bpf_timer_cancel_and_free, this patch frees the timer->timer\nafter a rcu grace period. This requires a rcu_head addition\nto the \"struct bpf_hrtimer\". Another kfree(t) happens in bpf_timer_init,\nthis does not need a kfree_rcu because it is still under the\nspin_lock and timer->timer has not been visible by others yet.\nIn bpf_timer_cancel, rcu_read_lock() is added because this helper\ncan be used in a non rcu critical section context (e.g. from\na sleepable bpf prog). Other timer->timer usages in helpers.c\nhave been audited, bpf_timer_cancel() is the only place where\ntimer->timer is used outside of the spin_lock.\nAnother solution considered is to mark a t->flag in bpf_timer_cancel\nand clear it after hrtimer_cancel() is done.  In bpf_timer_cancel_and_free,\nit busy waits for the flag to be cleared before kfree(t). This patch\ngoes with a straight forward solution and frees timer->timer after\na rcu grace period.",

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw."

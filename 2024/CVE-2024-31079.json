	"details": [
		"When NGINX Plus or NGINX OSS are configured to use the HTTP/3 QUIC module, undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can cause NGINX worker processes to terminate or causeÂ other potential impact. This attack requires that a request be specifically timed during the connection draining process, which the attacker has no visibility and limited influence over.",
		"A flaw was found in the nginx HTTP/3 implementation. Undisclosed HTTP/3 requests can trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, causing worker processes to crash and lead to a denial of service."
	],
	"statement": "To exploit this flaw, a request must be specifically timed during the connection draining process, which the attacker has no visibility and limited influence. For this reason, this flaw has been rated with a Moderate severity.\nThe nginx package as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, 9 and RHSCL is not affected by this vulnerability because the support for HTTP/3 is not enabled and the vulnerable code was introduced in a later version of nginx.",

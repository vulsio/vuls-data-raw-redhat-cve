		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet, sunrpc: Remap EPERM in case of connection failure in xs_tcp_setup_socket\nWhen using a BPF program on kernel_connect(), the call can return -EPERM. This\ncauses xs_tcp_setup_socket() to loop forever, filling up the syslog and causing\nthe kernel to potentially freeze up.\nNeil suggested:\nThis will propagate -EPERM up into other layers which might not be ready\nto handle it. It might be safer to map EPERM to an error we would be more\nlikely to expect from the network system - such as ECONNREFUSED or ENETDOWN.\nECONNREFUSED as error seems reasonable. For programs setting a different error\ncan be out of reach (see handling in 4fbac77d2d09) in particular on kernels\nwhich do not have f10d05966196 (\"bpf: Make BPF_PROG_RUN_ARRAY return -err\ninstead of allow boolean\"), thus given that it is better to simply remap for\nconsistent behavior. UDP does handle EPERM in xs_udp_send_request()."

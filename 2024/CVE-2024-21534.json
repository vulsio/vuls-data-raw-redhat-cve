	"details": [
		"Versions of the package jsonpath-plus before 10.0.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) due to improper input sanitization. An attacker can execute aribitrary code on the system by exploiting the unsafe default usage of vm in Node.\n**Note:**\nThe unsafe behavior is still available after applying the fix but it is not turned on by default.",
		"A flaw was found in jsonpath-plus. This vulnerability allows remote code execution via improper input sanitisation and unsafe default usage of the vm module in Node.js. Attackers can exploit this by executing arbitrary code through the unsafe use of the vm module in Node.js, which allows for malicious code injection. This issue occurs due to the way jsonpath-plus evaluates JSON paths using vm, a Node.js module that allows code execution. If user input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can craft JSON paths that execute dangerous commands, such as reading sensitive files."
	],
	"statement": "The vulnerability has been addressed, however, it is important to note that the unsafe behavior is still present but is no longer enabled by default. Developers using older versions or relying on this unsafe behavior could still be at risk.",

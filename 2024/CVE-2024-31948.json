	"cwe": "CWE-248",
	"details": [
		"In FRRouting (FRR) through 9.1, an attacker using a malformed Prefix SID attribute in a BGP UPDATE packet can cause the bgpd daemon to crash.",
		"An uncaught exception flaw was found in FRRouting. This flaw allows an attacker using a malformed Prefix SID attribute in a BGP UPDATE packet to cause the bgpd daemon to crash."
	],
	"statement": "The uncaught exception flaw in FRRouting's bgpd daemon, triggered by a malformed Prefix SID attribute in a BGP UPDATE packet, poses a moderate severity risk due to its potential to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. While the vulnerability results in a crash of the bgpd daemon, leading to disruption of routing services, it primarily affects the availability aspect of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). Although the flaw does not directly expose sensitive information or allow unauthorized access to the system, the ability to crash a critical routing component could impact network operations and service availability. However, the exploitation requires a targeted and deliberate action by an attacker, limiting its immediate widespread impact compared to high severity vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or complete system compromise.",

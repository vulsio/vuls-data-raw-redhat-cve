		"In OpenStack Ironic before 21.4.4, 22.x and 23.x before 23.0.3, 23.x and 24.x before 24.1.3, and 25.x and 26.x before 26.1.0, there is a lack of checksum validation of supplied image_source URLs when configured to convert images to a raw format for streaming.",
		"A flaw was found in OpenStack Ironic. The lack of checksum verification allows an attacker with access to the images to modify an image without the change noticed by OpenStack. This issue leads to integrity issues in the image."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability is classified as moderate severity rather than important because it requires a specific set of conditions for exploitation. An attacker must have access to the image source and be positioned to intercept or modify images during their transmission, which limits the attack surface to environments with insecure or untrusted network configurations. Additionally, the vulnerability only impacts Ironic when it is configured to convert images to raw format for streaming, making it a less common scenario. The absence of checksum validation could compromise image integrity, but it does not grant direct control over the system or immediate escalation of privileges, hence the moderate classification.",

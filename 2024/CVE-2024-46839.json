		"[REJECTED CVE] A performance issue in the Linux Kernel's workqueue subsystem can cause hard lockups on high-CPU systems during operations like CPU hotplugging. The issue arises from contention when multiple CPUs update the global wq_watchdog_touched variable, leading to degraded performance and lockups in workqueue management routines."

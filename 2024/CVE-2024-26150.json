In `@backstage/backend-common` prior to versions 0.21.1, 0.20.2, and 0.19.10, paths checks with the `resolveSafeChildPath` utility were not exhaustive enough, leading to risk of path traversal vulnerabilities if symlinks can be injected by attackers.

	"statement": "RHDH actions do not use symlinks and would not be exposed.  There is a small chance that customers can use 3rd party software templates that use symlinks but it's a low risk and to our knowledge, none of our customers are going into production with 1.0.  If they had intentions to, we would advise them to use 1.1 which is patched already.\nSince 1.0 is in maintenance mode, our decision is aligned with our lifecycle policy to only backport critical and important CVEs.  So marking as would not fix.",

	"details": [
		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nibmvnic: Add tx check to prevent skb leak\nBelow is a summary of how the driver stores a reference to an skb during\ntransmit:\ntx_buff[free_map[consumer_index]]->skb = new_skb;\nfree_map[consumer_index] = IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP;\nconsumer_index ++;\nWhere variable data looks like this:\nfree_map == [4, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, IBMVNIC_INVALID_MAP, 0, 3]\nconsumer_index^\ntx_buff == [skb=null, skb=<ptr>, skb=<ptr>, skb=null, skb=null]\nThe driver has checks to ensure that free_map[consumer_index] pointed to\na valid index but there was no check to ensure that this index pointed\nto an unused/null skb address. So, if, by some chance, our free_map and\ntx_buff lists become out of sync then we were previously risking an\nskb memory leak. This could then cause tcp congestion control to stop\nsending packets, eventually leading to ETIMEDOUT.\nTherefore, add a conditional to ensure that the skb address is null. If\nnot then warn the user (because this is still a bug that should be\npatched) and free the old pointer to prevent memleak/tcp problems."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability exists in the driver for IBM System i/p virtual network adapters. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause a leak in memory pools used for processing network traffic, which can cause the kernel's congestion control mechanisms to erroneously stop transmitting packets, effectively a denial of service. Because the affected hardware is uncommon, and because an attacker must be able to generate a large amount of network traffic that is handled specifically by a virtual NIC on that hardware, Red Hat assesses the impact of this vulnerability as Low.",

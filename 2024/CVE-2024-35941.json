	"details": [
		"[REJECTED CVE] A use-after-free vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernel's net subsystem, specifically in skbuff handling. The issue arises from an overflow of the skb->network_header (a u16 value), causing skb_network_offset(skb) to return a negative value. This results in the __skb_pull() function incorrectly adjusting skb->data to an invalid memory location outside the skb->head area. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause memory corruption or crash the system, potentially leading to denial of service or other undefined behavior."

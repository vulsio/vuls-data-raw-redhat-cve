Prior to version 5.4.1, due to default case-insensitive collation in MySQL or MariaDB databases, third-party authentication user IDs are not case-sensitive and could cause different IDs to match. This issue has been addressed by a fix released in version 5.4.1. An immediate workaround would be to change collation of the affected field.",

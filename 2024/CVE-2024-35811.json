		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nwifi: brcmfmac: Fix use-after-free bug in brcmf_cfg80211_detach\nThis is the candidate patch of CVE-2023-47233 :\nhttps://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-47233\nIn brcm80211 driver,it starts with the following invoking chain\nto start init a timeout worker:\n->brcmf_usb_probe\n->brcmf_usb_probe_cb\n->brcmf_attach\n->brcmf_bus_started\n->brcmf_cfg80211_attach\n->wl_init_priv\n->brcmf_init_escan\n->INIT_WORK(&cfg->escan_timeout_work,\nbrcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker);\nIf we disconnect the USB by hotplug, it will call\nbrcmf_usb_disconnect to make cleanup. The invoking chain is :\nbrcmf_usb_disconnect\n->brcmf_usb_disconnect_cb\n->brcmf_detach\n->brcmf_cfg80211_detach\n->kfree(cfg);\nWhile the timeout woker may still be running. This will cause\na use-after-free bug on cfg in brcmf_cfg80211_escan_timeout_worker.\nFix it by deleting the timer and canceling the worker in\nbrcmf_cfg80211_detach.\n[arend.vanspriel@broadcom.com: keep timer delete as is and cancel work just before free]",
		"A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the `brcmf_cfg80211_detach` function of the `brcmfmac` driver in the Linux Kernel, which could lead to security risks or system instability. This issue was resolved to prevent unauthorized access to freed memory that could have been exploited for malicious purposes."

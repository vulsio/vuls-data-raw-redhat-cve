	"details": [
		"Calling `PK11_Encrypt()` in NSS using CKM_CHACHA20 and the same buffer for input and output can result in plaintext on an Intel Sandy Bridge processor. In Firefox this only affects the QUIC header protection feature when the connection is using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suite. The most likely outcome is connection failure, but if the connection persists despite the high packet loss it could be possible for a network observer to identify packets as coming from the same source despite a network path change. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 129, Firefox ESR < 115.14, and Firefox ESR < 128.1.",
		"The Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory describes this flaw as:\nCalling PK11_Encrypt() in NSS using CKM_CHACHA20 and the same buffer for input and output can result in plaintext on Intel Sandy Bridge and later processors. In Firefox this only affects the QUIC header protection feature when the connection is using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 cipher suite. The most likely outcome is connection failure, but if the connection persists despite the high packet loss it could be possible for a network observer to identify packets as coming from the same source despite a network path change."

	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of this flaw as determined by the Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory.\nFirefox and Thunderbird in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 and later are not affected by this vulnerability, as they use the system NSS library. Firefox and Thunderbird in earlier Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 extended life streams were affected, and should be updated to fixed versions as they become available.",

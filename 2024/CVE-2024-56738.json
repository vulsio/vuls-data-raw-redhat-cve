	"cwe": "CWE-208",
	"details": [
		"GNU GRUB (aka GRUB2) through 2.12 does not use a constant-time algorithm for grub_crypto_memcmp and thus allows side-channel attacks.",
		"A flaw was found in GRUB2. Affected versions of GRUB2 do not use a constant-time algorithm for grub_crypto_memcmp, which can allow side-channel attacks."
	],
	"statement": "Due to the extremely limited conditions needed for exploitation, this vulnerability is classified as low severity. Due to GRUB using libgcrypt during HTTPS operations, there is potential for a side-channel attack that could enable an attacker to infer TLS session key information. However, because GRUB runs in a single-threaded context during boot, it eliminates the common attack vector of timing measurements across threads, so it reduces the potential for exploitation in most situations. Additionally, many configurations offload HTTPS/TLS handling to UEFI or do not enable libgcrypt for HTTPS at all, leaving the vulnerable code path unused.",

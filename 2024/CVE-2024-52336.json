	"cwe": "CWE-269",
	"details": [
		"A script injection vulnerability was identified in the Tuned package. The `instance_create()` D-Bus function can be called by locally logged-in users without authentication. This flaw allows a local non-privileged user to execute a D-Bus call with `script_pre` or `script_post` options that permit arbitrary scripts with their absolute paths to be passed. These user or attacker-controlled executable scripts or programs could then be executed by Tuned with root privileges that could allow attackers to local privilege escalation.",

	],
	"statement": "The `instance_create()` D-Bus method has been added via upstream commit cddcd233 and was first part of version tag v2.23.0. Hence, versions of Tuned before 2.23.0 are unaffected. Also, note that the initial versions already contained support for the script option parameters and the `instance_name` parameter.",

	"cwe": "CWE-94",
	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in Node.js. On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if they have been set by an unprivileged user while the process is running with elevated privileges, with the exception of CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. Due to a bug in the implementation of this exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this exception even when other capabilities have been set. This may allow unprivileged users to inject code that inherits the processes elevated privileges."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability is classified as important severity rather than Critical due to several factors. While it does allow unprivileged users to inject code and potentially escalate privileges in a process running with elevated privileges, it does so under specific conditions and with limitations. The vulnerability only affects Linux systems where Node.js is running with elevated privileges, and it relies on a specific bug in the handling of environment variables set by unprivileged users. Additionally, the impact is constrained to the Node.js environment and does not directly compromise the underlying operating system.",

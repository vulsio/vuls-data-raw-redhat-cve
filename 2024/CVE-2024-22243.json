	"details": [
		"Applications that use UriComponentsBuilder to parse an externally provided URL (e.g. through a query parameter) AND perform validation checks on the host of the parsed URL may be vulnerable to a  open redirect https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html  attack or to a SSRF attack if the URL is used after passing validation checks.",
		"A vulnerability was discovered in Spring Framework. Under certain conditions, an attacker might be able to trigger an open redirect. This issue can simplify the process of conducting a phishing attack against users of the deployment."
	],
	"statement": "The open redirect vulnerability discovered in the Spring Framework poses a moderate severity issue due to its potential to facilitate phishing attacks. While it doesn't directly lead to data compromise or system takeover, it significantly increases the likelihood of users being misled into visiting malicious websites.",

This arises from differing response times to malformed ciphertexts compared to correctly padded ones. The issue is further highlighted by its association with CVE-2024-0553, which is marked as an incomplete resolution for a previously identified vulnerability, CVE-2023-5981, indicating a potential persistence or recurrence of the problem.",

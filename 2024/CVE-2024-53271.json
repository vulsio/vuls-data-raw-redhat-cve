		"Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In affected versions envoy  does not properly handle http 1.1 non-101 1xx responses. This can lead to downstream failures in networked devices. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.31.5 and 1.32.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
		"A flaw was found in Envoy. In affected versions, Envoy does not properly handle certain HTTP 1.1 responses. Specially-crafted requests may trigger failures or application crashes in networked devices, leading to a denial of service."

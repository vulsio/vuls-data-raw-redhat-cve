		"This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority for the following reason: After careful review of CVE-2024-5203, it has been determined that the issue is not exploitable in real-world scenarios. Moreover, the exploit assumes that the attacker has access to a session code parameter that matches a cookie on the Keycloak server. However the attacker does not have access to the cookie, and can therefore not craft a malicious request.",
		"A Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw was found in Keycloak and occurs due to the lack of a unique token sent during the authentication POST request, /login-actions/authenticate. This flaw allows an attacker to craft a malicious login page and trick a legitimate user of an application into authenticating with an attacker-controlled account instead of their own."

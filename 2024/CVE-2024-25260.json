	"details": [
		"elfutils v0.189 was discovered to contain a NULL pointer dereference via the handle_verdef() function at readelf.c.",
		"A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability in the elfutils library has been discovered. This vulnerability occurs within the handle_verdef() function in the readelf.c source file. A NULL pointer dereference typically happens when a program attempts to access memory using a pointer that is not pointing anywhere (i.e., it's NULL), leading to a crash or potentially exploitable behavior."
	],
	"statement": "This incident was classified as a standard bug rather than a security concern. Crashes in standalone utilities triggered by untrusted inputs typically aren't regarded as security issues since they don't lead to privilege escalation. It's important to highlight that unless eu-readelf is instrumented with AddressSanitizer, no actual crash occurs; instead, eu-readelf simply prints a random global string.",

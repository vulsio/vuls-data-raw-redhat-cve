	"details": [
		"Libarchive before 3.7.4 allows name out-of-bounds access when a ZIP archive has an empty-name file and mac-ext is enabled. This occurs in slurp_central_directory in archive_read_support_format_zip.c.",
		"An out-of-bounds access flaw was found in libarchive in the slurp_central_directory function at archive_read_support_format_zip.c. This vulnerability may be triggered if a ZIP archive has an empty name and the mac-ext is enabled."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability in libarchive is rated with an Important severity because it involves an out-of-bounds access when processing ZIP archives with empty filenames and the mac-ext option enabled. Such vulnerabilities can lead to undefined behavior, including potential exploitation by attackers to execute arbitrary code, causing a denial of service, or exfiltrating sensitive information. The flaw lies in the slurp_central_directory function within archive_read_support_format_zip.c, where improper handling of file names leads to memory access violations.",

	"details": [
		"CUPS is a standards-based, open-source printing system, and cups-filters provides backends, filters, and other software for CUPS 2.x to use on non-Mac OS systems. Any value passed to `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` via a PPD file will be executed as a user controlled command. When combined with other logic bugs as described in CVE_2024-47176, this can lead to remote command execution.",
		"A security flaw was found in OpenPrinting CUPS. A remote attacker may be able to exploit cups-filters via the `FoomaticRIPCommandLine` entry in the PPD file, which would trigger the CUPS system to execute any arbitrary commands injected into that file when a print job is sent to the affected device."

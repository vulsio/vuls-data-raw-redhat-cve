	"cwe": "CWE-390",
	"details": [
		"nghttp2 is an implementation of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol version 2 in C. The nghttp2 library prior to version 1.61.0 keeps reading the unbounded number of HTTP/2 CONTINUATION frames even after a stream is reset to keep HPACK context in sync.  This causes excessive CPU usage to decode HPACK stream. nghttp2 v1.61.0 mitigates this vulnerability by limiting the number of CONTINUATION frames it accepts per stream. There is no workaround for this vulnerability.",
		"A vulnerability was found in how nghttp2 implements the HTTP/2 protocol. There are insufficient limitations placed on the amount of CONTINUATION frames that can be sent within a single stream. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send packets to vulnerable servers, which could use up compute or memory resources to cause a Denial of Service."
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat rates the security impact of this vulnerability as Moderate, in alignment with upstream nghttp2. The worst case scenario is excessive CPU utilization causing a denial of service. Once an attack has ended, the system should return to normal operations on its own.",

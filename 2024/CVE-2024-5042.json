	"statement": "For the submariner operator in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, the submariner-security outlined potential vulnerabilities regarding RBAC permissions being too broad. Those permissions make it possible to create, patch or update statefulsets or replicasets resources. This may allow new privileged containers escaping them and gaining root privileges on any worker nodes where those containers have been deployed within the cluster.",

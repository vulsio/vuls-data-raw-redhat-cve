When attempting to create an item prohibited by `ACL#hasCreatePermission2` or `TopLevelItemDescriptor#isApplicableIn(ItemGroup)` through the Jenkins CLI or the REST API, if either of these checks fail, Jenkins creates the item in memory and only deletes it from disk. This may allow an attacker with the Item/Configure permission to save the item, effectively bypassing the item creation restriction."

	],
	"statement": "The race condition in osbuild-composer that leads to unintentional GPG verification disabling for third-party repositories introduces a moderate severity risk. While the issue can potentially allow the installation of untrusted code into built images, its impact is limited to scenarios where both a third-party repository with GPG-checked RPMs and another repository with GPG checking disabled are concurrently added. Additionally, the insecure setting winning due to the race condition further narrows the circumstances under which the vulnerability can be exploited. However, the potential for bypassing GPG verification in specific configurations poses a tangible risk to the integrity of built images, justifying its classification as a moderate severity issue.",

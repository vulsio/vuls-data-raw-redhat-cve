	"details": [
		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nBluetooth: L2CAP: do not leave dangling sk pointer on error in l2cap_sock_create()\nbt_sock_alloc() allocates the sk object and attaches it to the provided\nsock object. On error l2cap_sock_alloc() frees the sk object, but the\ndangling pointer is still attached to the sock object, which may create\nuse-after-free in other code."
	],
	"statement": "The bug could happen only for some complex conditions (on error path and during closing connection). It would not be simple to use it for attack, so attack complexity it high. Unlikely that would be possible to trigger it remotely. No known reproducer. The security impact is limited.",

		"description": "net/http: Denial of service due to improper 100-continue handling in net/http",
		"id": "2295310",
		"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2295310"
	},
	"details": [
		"The net/http HTTP/1.1 client mishandled the case where a server responds to a request with an \"Expect: 100-continue\" header with a non-informational (200 or higher) status. This mishandling could leave a client connection in an invalid state, where the next request sent on the connection will fail. An attacker sending a request to a net/http/httputil.ReverseProxy proxy can exploit this mishandling to cause a denial of service by sending \"Expect: 100-continue\" requests which elicit a non-informational response from the backend. Each such request leaves the proxy with an invalid connection, and causes one subsequent request using that connection to fail."

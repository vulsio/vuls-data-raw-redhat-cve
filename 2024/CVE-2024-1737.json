		"Resolver caches and authoritative zone databases that hold significant numbers of RRs for the same hostname (of any RTYPE) can suffer from degraded performance as content is being added or updated, and also when handling client queries for this name.\nThis issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.11.0 through 9.11.37, 9.16.0 through 9.16.50, 9.18.0 through 9.18.27, 9.19.0 through 9.19.24, 9.11.4-S1 through 9.11.37-S1, 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.50-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through 9.18.27-S1.",
		"A flaw was found in the bind9 package, where a hostname with significant resource records may slow down bind's resolver cache and authoritative zone databases while these records are being added or updated. In addition, client queries for the related hostname may cause the same issue. This vulnerability may lead to a denial of service."

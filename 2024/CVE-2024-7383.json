	"statement": "This CVE is rated as Moderate because it requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer. While this can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of resources, the vulnerability is considered to be difficult to exploit under normal circumstances.",

		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nexec: Fix ToCToU between perm check and set-uid/gid usage\nWhen opening a file for exec via do_filp_open(), permission checking is\ndone against the file's metadata at that moment, and on success, a file\npointer is passed back. Much later in the execve() code path, the file\nmetadata (specifically mode, uid, and gid) is used to determine if/how\nto set the uid and gid. However, those values may have changed since the\npermissions check, meaning the execution may gain unintended privileges.\nFor example, if a file could change permissions from executable and not\nset-id:\n---------x 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\nto set-id and non-executable:\n---S------ 1 root root 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\nit is possible to gain root privileges when execution should have been\ndisallowed.\nWhile this race condition is rare in real-world scenarios, it has been\nobserved (and proven exploitable) when package managers are updating\nthe setuid bits of installed programs. Such files start with being\nworld-executable but then are adjusted to be group-exec with a set-uid\nbit. For example, \"chmod o-x,u+s target\" makes \"target\" executable only\nby uid \"root\" and gid \"cdrom\", while also becoming setuid-root:\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\nbecomes:\n-rwsr-xr-- 1 root cdrom 16048 Aug  7 13:16 target\nBut racing the chmod means users without group \"cdrom\" membership can\nget the permission to execute \"target\" just before the chmod, and when\nthe chmod finishes, the exec reaches brpm_fill_uid(), and performs the\nsetuid to root, violating the expressed authorization of \"only cdrom\ngroup members can setuid to root\".\nRe-check that we still have execute permissions in case the metadata\nhas changed. It would be better to keep a copy from the perm-check time,\nbut until we can do that refactoring, the least-bad option is to do a\nfull inode_permission() call (under inode lock). It is understood that\nthis is safe against dead-locks, but hardly optimal."

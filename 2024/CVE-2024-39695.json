		"Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.2. The vulnerability is in the parser for the ASF video format, which was a new feature in v0.28.0. The out-of-bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video file. The bug is fixed in version v0.28.3.",

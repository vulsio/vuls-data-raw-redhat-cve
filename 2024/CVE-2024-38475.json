	"cwe": "CWE-116",
	"details": [
		"Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure. \nSubstitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag \"UnsafePrefixStat\" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained.",
		"A flaw was found in the mod_rewrite module of httpd. Improper escaping of output allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally or directly reachable by any URL. This issue results in code execution or source code disclosure."
	],
	"statement": "This issue affects configurations with substitution rules used in the RewriteRule directive using backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution.\nAdditionally, this flaw requires mod_rewrite to be loaded and used. This module can be disabled if its functionality is not needed.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.",

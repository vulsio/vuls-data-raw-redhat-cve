	"details": [
		"Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. In affected versions if a Next.js application is performing authorization in middleware based on pathname, it was possible for this authorization to be bypassed for pages directly under the application's root directory. For example: * [Not affected] `https://example.com/` * [Affected] `https://example.com/foo` * [Not affected] `https://example.com/foo/bar`. This issue is patched in Next.js `14.2.15` and later. If your Next.js application is hosted on Vercel, this vulnerability has been automatically mitigated, regardless of Next.js version. There are no official workarounds for this vulnerability.",
		"A flaw was found in the Next.js framework. An incorrectly sanitized query parameter can cause an invalid routing condition, resulting in the wrong route being served to users and allowing authorization bypass when an application is performing path-based middleware authorization."

	"details": [
		"In OpenStack Ironic before 26.0.1 and ironic-python-agent before 9.13.1, there is a vulnerability in image processing, in which a crafted image could be used by an authenticated user to exploit undesired behaviors in qemu-img, including possible unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data. The affected/fixed version details are: Ironic: <21.4.3, >=22.0.0 <23.0.2, >=23.1.0 <24.1.2, >=25.0.0 <26.0.1; Ironic-python-agent: <9.4.2, >=9.5.0 <9.7.1, >=9.8.0 <9.11.1, >=9.12.0 <9.13.1.",
		"A vulnerability was found in OpenStack Ironic. This flaw allows an authenticated user to use a specially crafted image to exploit undesired behaviors in qemu-img, including possible unauthorized access to potentially sensitive data."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability in OpenStack Ironic is of high severity because it enables an authenticated user to craft malicious images that exploit the image format detection process. Since qemu-img automatically loads all image drivers to inspect the input data, an attacker can leverage unsafe features within certain image formats to trigger unexpected behaviors, including unauthorized access to sensitive memory or data leakage. The exposure of potentially sensitive data and the ability to exploit the image processing pipeline pose high risks to system integrity, particularly in environments like OpenStack Ironic, where bare-metal provisioning demands secure and precise control of image operations.",

	"details": [
		"A SMB force-authentication vulnerability exists in all versions of OPA for Windows prior to v0.68.0. The vulnerability exists because of improper input validation, allowing a user to pass an arbitrary SMB share instead of a Rego file as an argument to OPA CLI or to one of the OPA Go library’s functions.",

	],
	"statement": "The SMB force-authentication vulnerability in OPA for Windows builds is classified as moderate severity due to its specific exploitation requirements and potential impact. The flaw arises from improper input validation, allowing an attacker to supply an arbitrary SMB share instead of a Rego file. However, exploitation of this issue necessitates direct access to the OPA CLI or its Go library functions, and the attacker must have the ability to influence the arguments passed to these components. While it could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data if exploited, the attack vector is limited and requires specific conditions to be met.",

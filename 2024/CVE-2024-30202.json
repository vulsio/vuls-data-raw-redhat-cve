		"In Emacs before 29.3, arbitrary Lisp code is evaluated as part of turning on Org mode. This affects Org Mode before 9.6.23.",
		"A flaw was found in Emacs. Arbitrary Lisp code can be evaluated when an Org mode file is opened or when the Org mode is being enabled, resulting in arbitrary code execution."
	],
	"statement": "The Emacs package, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and 9, is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of Emacs.\nTo exploit this flaw, an attacker needs to trick a user into opening a crafted Org mode file. For this reason, this flaw has been rated with a Moderate security impact.",

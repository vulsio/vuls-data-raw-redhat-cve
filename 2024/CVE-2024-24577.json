	"cwe": "CWE-122",
	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in libgit2, a cross-platform, linkable library implementation of Git. A specially crafted payload to git_index_add can cause heap corruption that could be leveraged for arbitrary code execution. The attacker must be able to trigger two consecutive calls to git_index_add with a filename that starts with a / character to exploit this vulnerability. To control the heap corruption, the attacker must be able to control the ctime field of the git_index_entry data structure."
	],
	"statement": "Cargo in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 & 9 does use a bundled libgit2. However, cargo does not call git_index_add directly, and the only indirect call I can find is via git_reset, which does not involve any externally-provided paths. Therefore, Red Hat Enterprise Linux should be Not Affected by this CVE.",

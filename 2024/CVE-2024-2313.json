	"details": [
		"If kernel headers need to be extracted, bpftrace will attempt to load them from a temporary directory. An unprivileged attacker could use this to force bcc to load compromised linux headers. Linux distributions which provide kernel headers by default are not affected by default.",
		"A flaw was found in BPFtrace. This issue occurs when extracting kernel headers, it tries to load them from a temporary directory. This issue could allow an attacker to force bpftrace to load compromised Linux headers by placing malicious headers in the temporary directory, leading to potential security risks, unauthorized access, or system compromise."

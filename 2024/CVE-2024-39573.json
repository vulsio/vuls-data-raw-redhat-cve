		"Potential SSRF in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to cause unsafe RewriteRules to unexpectedly setup URL's to be handled by mod_proxy.\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.",

These modules can be disabled via the configuration file if their functionality are not needed.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected by this vulnerability because the vulnerable code was introduced in a newer version of httpd.",

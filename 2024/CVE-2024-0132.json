	"details": [
		"NVIDIA Container Toolkit 1.16.1 or earlier contains a Time-of-check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) vulnerability when used with default configuration where a specifically crafted container image may gain access to the host file system. This does not impact use cases where CDI is used. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to code execution, denial of service, escalation of privileges, information disclosure, and data tampering."
	],
	"statement": "Due to certain circumstances, this vulnerability in the NVIDIA Container Toolkit is not affecting Red Hat Products and is rated as important severity rather than critical. First off, a specifically crafted container image is required for effective exploitation. We don't worry about this because we only offer Red Hat Signed containers. Additionally, user interaction is required for exploitation, further reducing the likelihood of an attack. Importantly, this vulnerability does not impact use cases that comply with our operating procedures by utilizing the Container Device Interface (CDI). As a result, this vulnerability does not affect us because we use CDI. Furthermore, for an attacker to deploy a crafted container image, they would need an environment that permits untrusted containers, a scenario that is not typical for Red Hat customers.",

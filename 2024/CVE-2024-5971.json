	"details": [
		"A vulnerability was found in Undertow, where the chunked response hangs after the body was flushed. The response headers and body were sent but the client would continue waiting as Undertow does not send the expected 0\\r\\n termination of the chunked response. This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios.",

This results in uncontrolled resource consumption, leaving the server side to a denial of service attack. This happens only with Java 17 TLSv1.3 scenarios."
	],
	"statement": "The identified vulnerability in Undertow, where chunked responses fail to terminate properly under Java 17 with TLSv1.3, represents a significant security concern due to its potential for uncontrolled resource consumption and denial of service (DoS) attacks. This issue arises from Undertow's mishandling of chunked response termination after initial data flushing, leading to clients waiting indefinitely for completion signals that are not sent. Such behavior could be exploited by malicious actors to exhaust server resources, resulting in service degradation or unavailability.",

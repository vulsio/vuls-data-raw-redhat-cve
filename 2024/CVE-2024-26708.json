		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmptcp: really cope with fastopen race\nFastopen and PM-trigger subflow shutdown can race, as reported by\nsyzkaller.\nIn my first attempt to close such race, I missed the fact that\nthe subflow status can change again before the subflow_state_change\ncallback is invoked.\nAddress the issue additionally copying with all the states directly\nreachable from TCP_FIN_WAIT1.",
		"A vulnerability was found in the subflow_simultaneous_connect() function in the mptcp component in the Linux kernel, where not all possible subflow states are evaluated, leading to a potential race condition. This issue could lead to undefined network behavior."

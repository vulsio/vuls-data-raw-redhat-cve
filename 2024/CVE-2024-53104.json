		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nmedia: uvcvideo: Skip parsing frames of type UVC_VS_UNDEFINED in uvc_parse_format\nThis can lead to out of bounds writes since frames of this type were not\ntaken into account when calculating the size of the frames buffer in\nuvc_parse_streaming.",
		"A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's USB Video Class driver. A buffer for video frame data is allocated, which does not account for all of the frame formats contained in a video stream, leading to an out-of-bounds write when a stream includes frames with an undefined format. An attacker who is able to influence the format of video streams captured by a system's USB video device could exploit this flaw to alter system memory and potentially escalate their privileges or execute arbitrary code."

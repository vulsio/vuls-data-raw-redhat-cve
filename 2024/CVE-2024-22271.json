		"In Spring Cloud Function framework, versions 4.1.x prior to 4.1.2, 4.0.x prior to 4.0.8 an application is vulnerable to a DOS attack when attempting to compose functions with non-existing functions.\nSpecifically, an application is vulnerable when all of the following are true:\nUser is using Spring Cloud Function Web module\nAffected Spring Products and Versions Spring Cloud Function Framework 4.1.0 to 4.1.2 4.0.0 to 4.0.8\nReferences  https://spring.io/security/cve-2022-22979   https://checkmarx.com/blog/spring-function-cloud-dos-cve-2022-22979-and-unintended-function-invocation/  History 2020-01-16: Initial vulnerability report published.",
		"A flaw was found in the Spring Cloud Function framework. Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to denial of service (DoS) when attempting to compose functions with nonexisting functions. This flaw allows an attacker to trigger a cache overflow."
	],
	"statement": "The vulnerability in the Spring Cloud Function framework, which allows an attacker to trigger a cache overflow by attempting to compose functions with nonexisting functions, represents a important severity issue due to its potential to facilitate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Such attacks can exploit the cache overflow mechanism to consume excessive computational resources, thereby degrading system performance and rendering the application unavailable to legitimate users.",

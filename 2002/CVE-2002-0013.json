	"details": [
		"Vulnerabilities in the SNMPv1 request handling of a large number of SNMP implementations allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or gain privileges via (1) GetRequest, (2) GetNextRequest, and (3) SetRequest messages, as demonstrated by the PROTOS c06-SNMPv1 test suite.  NOTE: It is highly likely that this candidate will be SPLIT into multiple candidates, one or more for each vendor.  This and other SNMP-related candidates will be updated when more accurate information is available."

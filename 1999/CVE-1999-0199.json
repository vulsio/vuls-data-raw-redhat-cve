	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security does not feel that this issue has any security impact because the CVE description suggests that a missing statement in the manpage could lead to a generalized developer awareness problem, that in turn could potentially lead to a flaw. Thus, there is no actual exploitable vulnerability reported in this CVE, but rather, the possibility that one could occur in some *unspecified* software which uses glibc where the developers haven't read the manpage since 1999. There is no direct way for a vulnerability to come to fruition in software based solely on developer knowledge (or lack thereof), but an *implementation* of that knowledge, which is absent from the description of this issue.\nThis manpage issue does not affect glibc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, 7, or 8 as the versions of glibc shipped already have the updated manpage."

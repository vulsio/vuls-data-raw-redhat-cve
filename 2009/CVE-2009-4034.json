	],
	"statement": "This issue is only security-relevant in PostgreSQL versions 8.4 and later as previous versions did not compare the connection host name with the certificate CommonName at all. Client certificate authentication was introduced in version 8.4. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and earlier provided PostgreSQL versions 8.1.x and earlier, and are thus not affected by this issue.",

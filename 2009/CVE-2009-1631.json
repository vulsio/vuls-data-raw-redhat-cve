	"csaw": false,
	"details": [
		"The Mailer component in Evolution 2.26.1 and earlier uses world-readable permissions for the .evolution directory, and certain directories and files under .evolution/ related to local mail, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading these files."

	],
	"statement": "Red Hat does not consider this to be a security issue. By default, user home directories are created with mode 0700 permissions, which would not expose the ~/.evolution/ directory regardless of its own permissions.\nIf a user intentionally relaxes permissions on their home directory, they should be auditing all files and directories in order to not expose unwanted files to other local users."

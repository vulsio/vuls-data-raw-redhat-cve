		"Stack-based buffer overflow in the parse_tag_11_packet function in fs/ecryptfs/keystore.c in the eCryptfs subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via vectors involving a crafted eCryptfs file, related to not ensuring that the key signature length in a Tag 11 packet is compatible with the key signature buffer size."

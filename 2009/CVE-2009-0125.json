		"** DISPUTED **  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the upstream vendor. nasl/nasl_crypto2.c in the Nessus Attack Scripting Language library (aka libnasl) 2.2.11 does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL DSA_do_verify function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.  NOTE: the upstream vendor has disputed this issue, stating \"while we do misuse this function (this is a bug), it has absolutely no security ramification.\""

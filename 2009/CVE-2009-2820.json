		"The web interface in CUPS before 1.4.2, as used on Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.2 and other platforms, does not properly handle (1) HTTP headers and (2) HTML templates, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and HTTP response splitting attacks via vectors related to (a) the product's web interface, (b) the configuration of the print system, and (c) the titles of printed jobs, as demonstrated by an XSS attack that uses the kerberos parameter to the admin program, and leverages attribute injection and HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) issues."

		"The lookup_cb_cred function in fs/nfsd/nfs4callback.c in the nfsd4 subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31.2 attempts to access a credentials cache even when a client specifies the AUTH_NULL authentication flavor, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via an NFSv4 mount request."

		"Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.3.x, 9.4 before 9.4.3-P4, 9.5 before 9.5.2-P1, 9.6 before 9.6.1-P2, and 9.7 beta before 9.7.0b3, with DNSSEC validation enabled and checking disabled (CD), allows remote attackers to conduct DNS cache poisoning attacks by receiving a recursive client query and sending a response that contains an Additional section with crafted data, which is not properly handled when the response is processed \"at the same time as requesting DNSSEC records (DO),\" aka Bug 20438."
	],
	"statement": "While this flaw exists in all 9.x versions, we do not plan to release bind updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 including this fix.  The version of bind shipped in those products is 9.2.4, which has an older DNSSEC implementation, which is incompatible with currently used DNSSEC version and can not be used to secure communication with current public internet DNS servers.\nThis flaw does not introduce additional risks to bind installations that are not using DNSSEC, as a successful attack requires bypass of other cache poisoning protections (such as random query source ports and transaction ids).  This flaw only allows for the bypass of protection provided by DNSSEC.",

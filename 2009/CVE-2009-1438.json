	"cwe": "CWE-190",
	"details": [
		"Integer overflow in the CSoundFile::ReadMed function (src/load_med.cpp) in libmodplug before 0.8.6, as used in gstreamer-plugins, TTPlayer, and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MED file with a crafted (1) song comment or (2) song name, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild in August 2008."
	],
	"statement": "The impact of this flaw is limited to application crash, not allowing code execution. Red Hat does not consider a user-assisted crash of a client application such as media players using GStreamer framework to be a security issue.\nFor further details, see: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2009-1438",

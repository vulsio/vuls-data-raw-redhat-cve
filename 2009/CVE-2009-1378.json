	"statement": "This issue did not affect versions of openssl as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4.\nNote that both the DTLS specification and OpenSSLs implementation is still in development and unlikely to be used in production environments. There is no component shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 using OpenSSLs DTLS implementation, except for OpenSSLs testing command line client - openssl.",

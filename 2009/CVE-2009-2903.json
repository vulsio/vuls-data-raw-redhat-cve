Please see https://access.redhat.com/articles/19069\nThis issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5, as the affected driver is not enabled in these kernels. The affected driver is available in Red Hat Enterprise MRG. It is also available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, but only if the kernel-unsupported package is installed. Future kernel updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG will address this issue.",

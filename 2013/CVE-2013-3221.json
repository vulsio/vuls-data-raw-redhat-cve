	"details": [
		"The Active Record component in Ruby on Rails 2.3.x, 3.0.x, 3.1.x, and 3.2.x does not ensure that the declared data type of a database column is used during comparisons of input values to stored values in that column, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct data-type injection attacks against Ruby on Rails applications via a crafted value, as demonstrated by unintended interaction between the \"typed XML\" feature and a MySQL database."
	],
	"statement": "Not a security issue.  This issue is due to the handling of data types when passing data between rubygem-activerecord and MySQL.  Applications that use rubygem-activerecord and MySQL may be affected if written in a way that exposes the issue, however any flaw would be specific to that application.

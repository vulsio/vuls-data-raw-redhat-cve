		"Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, and earlier, when the hypervisor is running \"under memory pressure\" and the Xen Security Module (XSM) is enabled, uses the wrong ordering of operations when extending the per-domain event channel tracking table, which causes a use-after-free and allows local guest kernels to inject arbitrary events and gain privileges via unspecified vectors."

	"statement": "Not vulnerable.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of the kernel-xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nThis issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as we did not have support for Xen hypervisor.",

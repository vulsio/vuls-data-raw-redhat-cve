	"details": [
		"Certain page table manipulation operations in Xen 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and earlier are not preemptible, which allows local PV kernels to cause a denial of service via vectors related to \"deep page table traversal.\""
	],
	"statement": "This issue did affect the versions of the kernel-xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nThis issue did not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.\nThe risks associated with fixing this bug are greater than its security impact. This issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future kernel-xen updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Using fully virtualized (HVM) guests, or PV guests with trusted kernel/administrator avoids this issue.",

	"statement": "Red Hat does not regard this to be a security flaw. The tomcat log directory does not contain any sensitive information, and when sensitive information has been written to log files, this has been considered a security flaw in tomcat (e.g. CVE-2011-2204). This issue was reported to the Apache Tomcat project, and they have not considered it a flaw in any published security advisories.",

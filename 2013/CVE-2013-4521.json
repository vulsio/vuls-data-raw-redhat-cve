	"details": [
		"RichFaces implementation in Nuxeo Platform 5.6.0 before HF27 and 5.8.0 before HF-01 does not restrict the classes for which deserialization methods can be called, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted serialized data. NOTE: this vulnerability may overlap CVE-2013-2165.",
		"A flaw was found in Nuxeo RichFaces where it improperly deserialized data. An attacker could use this flaw to obtain execution on deserialization methods on serializable classes deployed on the server. This can possibly lead to unauthenticated remote code execution."
	],
	"statement": "Not vulnerable. This flaw does not affect RichFaces as shipped with various JBoss products. These products use JBoss RichFaces, which is covered by CVE-2013-2165. This flaw pertains specifically to Nuxeo RichFaces.",

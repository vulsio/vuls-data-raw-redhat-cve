		"This CVE ID has been rejected or withdrawn by its CVE Numbering Authority for the following reason: DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none. Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: none.",

In most circumstances, the CIFS kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any network interfaces are active and the protocol is in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see the KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services."

	"details": [
		"Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write, delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. A read of uninitialized memory was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing, deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. The read of uninitialized memory is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.",
		"There's a flaw in exiv2's isWebPType() function. An attacker who submits a crafted file to be processed by an application linked with exiv2 could trigger an out-of-bounds read of unitialized memory, saving it to the stack. The great impact of this flaw is most likely to application availability with some potential impact to data confidentiality."
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security has rated this flaw as Low Impact because although the out-of-bounds read could be triggered, it does not necessarily return the information to an attacker, and another vulnerability would likely need to be exploited in order to trigger an information leak to the attacker.\nThis flaw is out of support scope for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.

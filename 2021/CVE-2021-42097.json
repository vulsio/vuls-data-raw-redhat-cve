		"GNU Mailman before 2.1.35 may allow remote Privilege Escalation. A csrf_token value is not specific to a single user account. An attacker can obtain a value within the context of an unprivileged user account, and then use that value in a CSRF attack against an admin (e.g., for account takeover).",
		"A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack can be performed in mailman due to a CSRF token bypass. CSRF tokens are not checked against the right user and a token created by one user can be used by another one to perform a request, effectively bypassing the protection provided by CSRF tokens. A remote attacker with an account on the mailman system can use this flaw to perform a CSRF attack and perform operations on behalf of the victim user."

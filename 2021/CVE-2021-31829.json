	"details": [
		"kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.1 performs undesirable speculative loads, leading to disclosure of stack content via side-channel attacks, aka CID-801c6058d14a. The specific concern is not protecting the BPF stack area against speculative loads. Also, the BPF stack can contain uninitialized data that might represent sensitive information previously operated on by the kernel.",
		"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's eBPF verification code. By default, accessing the eBPF verifier is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. This flaw allows a local user who can insert eBPF instructions, to use the eBPF verifier to abuse a spectre-like flaw and infer all system memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."

		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl. This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 kernel  to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for the root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities."

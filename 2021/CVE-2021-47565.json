		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nscsi: mpt3sas: Fix kernel panic during drive powercycle test\nWhile looping over shost's sdev list it is possible that one\nof the drives is getting removed and its sas_target object is\nfreed but its sdev object remains intact.\nConsequently, a kernel panic can occur while the driver is trying to access\nthe sas_address field of sas_target object without also checking the\nsas_target object for NULL."

	"statement": "Following issue marked as moderate with \"not affected\" for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, as it is not vulnerable to this CVE. This is because the CVE does not impact the versions or configurations of the Linux kernel used in Red Hat's distributions. Additionally, some RHEL versions may be marked as \"will not fix\" due to the minimal impact of the issue, and no fix will be provided.",

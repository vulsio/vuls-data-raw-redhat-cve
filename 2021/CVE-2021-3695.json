	"cwe": "CWE-787",
	"details": [
		"A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write in the heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be exploited as an attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the memory are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.",
		"A flaw was found in grub 2, where a crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to an out-of-bounds write. This flaw allows an attacker to corrupt the data on the heap portion of the grub2's memory, leading to possible code execution and the circumvention of the secure boot mechanism."
	],
	"statement": "Due to the nature of the input and how it's processed, a successful attack is considered very complex to be executed, as the same value is written out of bounds three times in a row.",

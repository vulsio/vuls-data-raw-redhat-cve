		"A double-free memory corruption flaw was found in OpenSSH 8.2, more specifically in ssh-agent application. This flaw allows an attacker with access to the agent socket to forward an agent either to an account shared with a malicious user or to a host with an attacker holding root access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."

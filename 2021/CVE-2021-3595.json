		"An invalid pointer initialization issue was found in the SLiRP networking implementation of QEMU.

This issue may lead to out-of-bounds read access or indirect host memory disclosure to the guest. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality. This flaw affects libslirp versions prior to 4.6.0.",

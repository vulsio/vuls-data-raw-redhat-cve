	],
	"statement": "The vulnerability in GNU Tar is rated as moderate severity because, while it results in a denial of service through memory leaks, its exploitation is constrained to the application's operational context without impacting the broader system integrity or security. The leak occurs in the `read_header()` function, where memory allocated for handling tar entries is not properly released, leading to resource exhaustion. However, this vulnerability does not facilitate arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, or data corruption, which are characteristic of higher-severity vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the memory leak is contingent upon user interaction, as it requires the extraction of maliciously crafted tar files, thereby limiting its potential for widespread exploitation.",

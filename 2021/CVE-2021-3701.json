		"A flaw was found in ansible-runner where the default temporary files configuration in ansible-2.0.0 are written to world R/W locations. This flaw allows an attacker to pre-create the directory, resulting in reading private information or forcing ansible-runner to write files as the legitimate user in a place they did not expect. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity.",

	"statement": "Red Hat Ceph Storage 4 ships an older version of ansible-runner, which does not include the affected code. However, it does use a hardcoded path to the private data, with shipping a vulnerable os.path.join functionality, which could result in an attacker pre-creating the directory for the private data with world R/W permissions as in this exploit. As a result, it has been assigned an impact of low.",

		"A flaw was found in the QXL display device emulation in QEMU. A double fetch of guest controlled values `cursor->header.width` and `cursor->header.height` can lead to the allocation of a small cursor object followed by a subsequent heap-based buffer overflow. A malicious privileged guest user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host or potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the QEMU process.",

	"statement": "Releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform 15 and newer consume fixes directly from the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization repository. A future update may address this issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and RHEL 8 Advanced Virtualization. The versions of `qemu-kvm` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 are not affected by this flaw as they do not include support for QXL display device emulation.",

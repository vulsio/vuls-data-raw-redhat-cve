	"details": [
		"Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer overflow bug in Redis 6.2 before 6.2.3 could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 6.0 and earlier are not directly affected by this issue. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.3. An additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the `redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the `CONFIG SET` command.",
		"A flaw was found in redis. An integer overflow bug could be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."

	"statement": "redis:6/redis and redis:5/redis shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are not affected by this flaw as they do not ship vulnerable versions of Redis.\nThe versions of Redis provided by Red Hat OpenStack Platform are not directly affected by this issue. As a result the impact is lowered and no update will be provided at this time.",

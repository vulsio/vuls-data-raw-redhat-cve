		"value": "Do not enable SMB1 (please note SMB1 is disabled by default in Samba from version 4.11.0 and onwards). This prevents the creation of symbolic links via SMB1. If SMB1 must be enabled for backward compatibility then add the parameter:\nunix extensions = no\nto the [global] section of your smb.conf and restart smbd. This prevents SMB1 clients from creating symlinks on the exported file system.\nHowever, if the same region of the file system is also exported using NFS, NFS clients can create symlinks that potentially can also hit the race condition. For non-patched versions of Samba, we recommend only exporting areas of the file system by either SMB2 or NFS, not both."

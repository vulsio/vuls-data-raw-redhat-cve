		"stb_image.h 2.27 has a heap-based buffer over in stbi__jpeg_load, leading to Information Disclosure or Denial of Service.",
		"A flaw was found in stb_image. This issue occurs while processing the frame header information when the plane sampling configurations are calculated in two different ways, generating different results due to integer approximation. The value is further used to access several buffers, leading to a heap based out-of-bound read. This causes a heap data leak or an application crash, resulting in a denial of service."

	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap in drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c in the Linux kernel before 5.14.6. Local attackers able to access the Aspeed LPC control interface could overwrite memory in the kernel and potentially execute privileges, aka CID-b49a0e69a7b1. This occurs because a certain comparison uses values that are not memory sizes.",
		"A vulnerability was found in aspeed_lpc_ctrl_mmap in drivers/soc/aspeed/aspeed-lpc-ctrl.c in Aspeed Low Pin Count (LPC) Bus Controller in the Linux kernel.  A miss in the sanity check may allow a malicious local normal privileged user to bypass the boundary check, and map pages that are located outside the memory region reserved by the driver."

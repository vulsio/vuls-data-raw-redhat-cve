	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in Mailman Core before 3.3.5. An attacker with access to the REST API could use timing attacks to determine the value of the configured REST API password and then make arbitrary REST API calls. The REST API is bound to localhost by default, limiting the ability for attackers to exploit this, but can optionally be made to listen on other interfaces.",
		"A timing attack was found in the mailman administrative REST API due to the usage of a simple string comparison function when checking the password. This flaw allows an attacker who can talk to the REST API to discover the admin password due to timing leaks."

	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of mailman as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 as they did not include support for the administrative REST API, which was introduced in mailman 3.\nThis flaw has a moderate Impact due to the requirement that is needed in order for an attacker to access the REST API. By default, the REST API is only accessible to localhost and it should never be exposed to the public internet, according to mailman documentation.",

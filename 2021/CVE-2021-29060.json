	"statement": "OpenShift Service Mesh 1.1.x is in its maintenance phase, only Important and Critical vulnerabilities will be fixed at this time.\nIn OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) and OpenShift Service Mesh (OSSM) some components include the vulnerable color-string library, but access is protected by OpenShift OAuth what reducing impact by this flaw to LOW.\nStarting in OCP 4.7, the kibana component is shipping as \"container first\" content and as a part of the OpenShift Logging product (openshift-logging/kibana6-rhel8) and is not affected by this vulnerability. The kibana components delivered in OCP 4.6 and earlier are marked as `Out of support scope` because these versions are already under Maintenance Phase of the support.\nIn Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) all containers are using the 1.5.5 fixed version, hence not RHACM version is affected by this flaw.\nIn Red Hat Virtualization a vulnerable version of color-string is used in ovirt-web-ui and ovirt-engine-ui-extensions. It is a build-time dependency not exploitable in the delivered product. Therefore impact is rated Low and it will not be immediately fixed. An update may be provided in future releases.",

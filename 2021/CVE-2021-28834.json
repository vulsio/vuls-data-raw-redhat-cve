	"cwe": "CWE-470",
	"details": [
		"Kramdown before 2.3.1 does not restrict Rouge formatters to the Rouge::Formatters namespace, and thus arbitrary classes can be instantiated.",
		"A flaw was found in rubygem-kramdown. Rouge is a syntax highlighter used by kramdown. Restriction of the Rouge formatters to the Rouge::Formatters namespace does not occur when Ruby's const_get() method is called. This can lead to arbitrary classes being instantiated in situations where the application using kramdown, for example, accepts user input to select a Rogue syntax highlighter formatter. The highest threat from this vulnerability when exploited in a vulnerable configuration is to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability."

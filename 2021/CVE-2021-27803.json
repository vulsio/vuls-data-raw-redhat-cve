	"details": [
		"A vulnerability was discovered in how p2p/p2p_pd.c in wpa_supplicant before 2.10 processes P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) provision discovery requests. It could result in denial of service or other impact (potentially execution of arbitrary code), for an attacker within radio range.",
		"A flaw was found in the wpa_supplicant, in the way it processes P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) provision discovery requests. This flaw allows an attacker who is within radio range of the device running P2P discovery to cause termination of the wpa_supplicant process or potentially cause code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
	],
	"statement": "An attacker (or a system controlled by the attacker) needs to be within radio range of the vulnerable system to send a set of suitably constructed management frames that trigger the corner case to be reached in the management of the P2P peer table.",

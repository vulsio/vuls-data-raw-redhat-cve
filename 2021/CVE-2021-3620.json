	"statement": "Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 no longer maintains its own version of Ansible. The prerequisite is to enable the Ansible repository in order to consume the latest version of Ansible, which has many bug and security fixes.\nRed Hat Ceph Storage 2 only provides fixes for bugs on an as-requested basis by a customer, and will not be fixed after discussion with engineering about the viability of a fix. Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 does not directly ship ansible, and thus is closed as won't fix.\nRed Hat Virtualization ships an affected version of ansible, however, the usage of ansible on the redhat-virtualization-host is only supported for self-hosted-engine installation and disaster recovery, where it is run locally. As such Impact is rated Moderate.",

		"Incremental zone transfers (IXFR) provide a way of transferring changed portion(s) of a zone between servers. An IXFR stream containing SOA records with an owner name other than the transferred zone's apex may cause the receiving named server to inadvertently remove the SOA record for the zone in question from the zone database. This leads to an assertion failure when the next SOA refresh query for that zone is made."

		"Lynx through 2.8.9 mishandles the userinfo subcomponent of a URI, which allows remote attackers to discover cleartext credentials because they may appear in SNI data.",
		"A flaw was found in the way lynx parsed URLs with userinfo part containing authentication credentials. These credentials were included in the Server Name Indication (SNI) TLS extension data and sent unencrypted during the TLS connection handshake. This could lead to exposure of authentication credentials to attackers able to eavesdrop on network connection between the lynx browser and the server."

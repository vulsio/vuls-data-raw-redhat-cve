	"details": [
		"Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier allows any agent to read and write the contents of any build directory stored in Jenkins with very few restrictions.",
		"An incorrect access restriction vulnerability was found in Jenkins. The directories agents are allowed to access include the directories where there are stored build-related information intended to allow agents to store build-related metadata during build execution. As a consequence, this allows an attacker who controls agent process to read and write the contents of any build directory stored in Jenkins with very few restrictions (build.xml and some Pipeline-related metadata)."

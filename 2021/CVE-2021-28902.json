	"details": [
		"In function read_yin_container() in libyang <= v1.0.225, it doesn't check whether the value of retval->ext[r] is NULL. In some cases, it can be NULL, which leads to the operation of retval->ext[r]->flags that results in a crash.",
		"A flaw was found in libyang. Missing checks in several read_yin_* functions lead to NULL pointer dereferences possibly allowing a remote attacker to crash an application that uses libyang with user-controlled YIN formats. The highest threat from this vulnerability is the service availability."

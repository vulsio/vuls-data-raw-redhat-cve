		"PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.",
		"A verification flaw was found in python-pysaml2, where it did not validate signed SAML documents against an XML schema. Because the flaw allowed invalid XML documents to be processed, a network attacker could exploit this flaw by tricking pysaml2 with a wrapped signature."

	"statement": "All versions of Red Hat OpenStack Platform ship but do not use the flawed check-signature functionality of python-pysaml2. The impact for these products is therefore rated as having a security impact of Low and will not be updated at this time.",

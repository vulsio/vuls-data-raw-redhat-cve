		"Improper URL handling in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.3 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.11 could allow remote code execution via via packet injection or crafted capture file.",
		"There's a flaw in Wireshark. An attacker who sends malicious links with schemes other than http/https over the wire or via a pcapng file, and who is able to get a victim user of Wireshark's user interface to click these links, could perform actions such as mounting volumes, or in some cases launching undesired programs."

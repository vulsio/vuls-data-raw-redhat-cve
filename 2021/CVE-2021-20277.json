	"statement": "The version of Samba shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage (RHGS) 3 is built with a private copy of ldb (LDAP-like embedded database) library which includes the vulnerable code. However, Samba shipped with RHGS 3 is not supported for use as an Active Directory Domain Controller and hence the impact has been lowered.",

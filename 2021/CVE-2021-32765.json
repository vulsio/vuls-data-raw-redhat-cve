		"Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.",
		"An integer overflow flaw when parsing array replies was found in hiredis, which leads to a buffer overflow and subsequent code execution. This flaw allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands and craft a malicious payload to execute commands on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."

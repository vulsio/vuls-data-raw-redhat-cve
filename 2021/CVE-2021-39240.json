For example, the authority field (as observed on a target HTTP/2 server) might differ from what the routing rules were intended to achieve.",
		"A flaw was found in haproxy. An input validation flaw when processing HTTP/2 requests causes haproxy to not ensure that the scheme and path portions of a URI have the expected characters.  This may cause specially crafted input to bypass implemented security restrictions. The highest threat from this vulnerability is confidentiality."

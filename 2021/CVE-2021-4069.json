	"details": [
		"vim is vulnerable to Use After Free",
		"A heap use-after-free flaw was found in Vim's ex_open() function in src/ex_docmd.c file. This flaw allows an attacker to trick the victim into opening a specially crafted file that triggers a use-after-free error, allowing the attacker to compromise the system and execute arbitrary code."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw has received a Low Severity rating because in order for the flaw to be triggered, a victim user must run an arbitrary input file (most likely provided by a malicious user) in Vim script mode using `-s {scriptin}`. Users running arbitrary Vim scripts are already open to security risks and this is NEVER recommended. Doing so with a privileged account is even more risky and not recommended.\nThis flaw does not reproduce on versions of Vim shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 or 8. Therefore, it has been marked as notaffected.",

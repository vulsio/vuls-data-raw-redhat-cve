	"statement": "In order to mount a minimal attack using this flaw, an attacker needs many pre-requisites to be able to even crash a program using this mq_notify bug:\n1. The program call to mq_notify needs to be controlled by the attacker\n2. The program must provide attributes to control creation of the notification thread in mq_notify\n3. The program must have the race condition where it may potentially destroy the notification thread attributes before the notification thread is created\n4. The program must set CPU affinity of the notification thread to actually cause the use-after-free dereference\nThere are no known applications that have *all* these pre-requisites.",

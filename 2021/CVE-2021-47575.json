	"details": [
		"[REJECTED CVE] The Xen console driver (hvc_xen) has a bug in event channel storms, where an excessive number of events sent by the backend could overwhelm the system. The issue stemmed from sending events even when no bytes were read from the backend, causing unnecessary interrupts. Additionally, during the domU initial console setup, there was no XenBus device available when the event channel was bound, complicating event handling."

		"Excessive memory consumption in MS-WSP dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 to 3.4.4 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.12 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file",
		"A flaw was found in wireshark. A memory leak in the MS-WSP dissector allows an attacker to crash an application which uses wireshark due to excessive memory allocation. The attacker can trigger the flaw by injecting special packets onto the wire or by convincing a victim user into opening a malformed packet trace file. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to application availability."

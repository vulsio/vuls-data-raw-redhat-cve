		"Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions Envoy transitions a H/2 connection to the CLOSED state when it receives a GOAWAY frame without any streams outstanding. The connection state is transitioned to DRAINING when it receives a SETTING frame with the SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS parameter set to 0. Receiving these two frames in the same I/O event results in abnormal termination of the Envoy process due to invalid state transition from CLOSED to DRAINING. A sequence of H/2 frames delivered by an untrusted upstream server will result in Denial of Service in the presence of untrusted **upstream** servers. Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4 contain fixes to stop processing of pending H/2 frames after connection transition to the CLOSED state.",
		"A vulnerability was found in envoyproxy/envoy, in which the application terminates abruptly. The error occurs when envoy receives a `GOAWAY` frame followed by a `SETTINGS` frame with the parameter `SETTING_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` to set 0. This flaw allows an attacker to cause a denial of service on the proxy. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."

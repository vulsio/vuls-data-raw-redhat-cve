		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nusb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints\nAs part of commit e81a7018d93a (\"usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure\ndynamically\") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free\nthe dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal when\nusb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit().\nHowever, simply freeing the gadget results a dangling pointer\nsituation: the endpoints created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints()\nhave their dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head\nanchored at dwc->gadget->ep_list.  Thus when dwc->gadget is freed,\nthe first dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and\nlikewise for the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list.\nThe dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a\nuse-after-free when it calls list_del().\nThis was caught by enabling KASAN and performing a driver unbind.\nThe recent commit 568262bf5492 (\"usb: dwc3: core: Add shutdown\ncallback for dwc3\") also exposes this as a panic during shutdown.\nThere are a few possibilities to fix this.  One could be to perform\na list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which removes it from\nthe rest of the dwc3_ep chain.\nAnother approach is what this patch does, by splitting up the\nusb_del_gadget_udc() call into its separate \"del\" and \"put\"\ncomponents.  This allows dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be\ncalled before the gadget is finally freed with usb_put_gadget()."

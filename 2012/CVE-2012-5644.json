	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "There are several restrictions to successful exploitation of this flaw:\n~~~\n1. ONLY applications compiled with libuser are affected. The affected code is hit only when a move operation is conducted on user home directory.\n2. The attacker needs to have a shell account on the target machine.\n3. Since this is a TOCTOU attack, precise timing is required for the attack. The attacker needs to know exactly when the move directory is moved in order successfully exploit this flaw.\n~~~\nAny other application acting on user directories (not compiled with libuser) for example usermod/userdel are not affected by this flaw."

		"pdo_sql_parser.re in the PDO extension in PHP before 5.3.14 and 5.4.x before 5.4.4 does not properly determine the end of the query string during parsing of prepared statements, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) via a crafted parameter value."

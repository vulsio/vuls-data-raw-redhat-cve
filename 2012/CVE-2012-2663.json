		"extensions/libxt_tcp.c in iptables through 1.4.21 does not match TCP SYN+FIN packets in --syn rules, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended firewall restrictions via crafted packets.  NOTE: the CVE-2012-6638 fix makes this issue less relevant."

	"statement": "This issue does affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.\nThe risks in breaking compatability associated with fixing this flaw outweigh the benefits of the fix, therefore Red Hat does not plan to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6.\nPlease note that the remote DoS issue in the way how Linux kernel treats SYN+FIN flags set is being handled under different CVE, CVE-2012-6638, and is planned to be fixed in all affected Red Hat Enterprise Linux releases.",

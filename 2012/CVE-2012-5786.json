		"** DISPUTED ** The wsdl_first_https sample code in distribution/src/main/release/samples/wsdl_first_https/src/main/ in Apache CXF before 2.7.0 does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate. NOTE: The vendor states that the sample had specifically used a flag to bypass the DN check."

	"statement": "Not vulnerable. Apache CXF is shipped with several Red Hat products, but the wsdl_first_https sample is not included. Without this sample code, the flaw is not exposed.",

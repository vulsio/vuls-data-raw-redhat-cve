	"details": [
		"Xen 3.4, 4.0, and 4.1, when the guest OS has not registered a handler for a syscall or sysenter instruction, does not properly clear a flag for exception injection when injecting a General Protection Fault, which allows local PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) by later triggering an exception that would normally be handled within Xen."
	],
	"statement": "Not vulnerable.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of the kernel-xen package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 as we did not have support for sysenter and compat (32bit) version of syscall instructions for PV guests running on the Xen hypervisor (introduced in upstream changeset 16207:aeebd173c3fa).\nThis issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as we did not have support for Xen hypervisor.",

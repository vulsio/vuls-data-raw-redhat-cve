		"Xen 4.0, and 4.1, when running a 64-bit PV guest on \"older\" AMD CPUs, does not properly protect against a certain AMD processor bug, which allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host hang) via sequential execution of instructions across a non-canonical boundary, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-0217."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as those versions have a guard page between the end of the user-mode accessible virtual address space and the beginning of the non-canonical area due to CVE-2005-1764 fix.\nThis issue did affect the versions of Xen hypervisor as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. A kernel-xen update for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is available to address this flaw.",

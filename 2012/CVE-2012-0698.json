	"details": [
		"tcsd in TrouSerS before 0.3.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted type_offset value in a TCP packet to port 30003.",
		"A flaw was found in the way tcsd, the daemon that manages Trusted Computing resources, processed incoming TCP packets. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted TCP packet that, when processed by tcsd, could cause the daemon to crash. Note that by default tcsd accepts requests on localhost only."
	],
	"statement": "The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact. Trousers is only useful on systems with TPM hardware, additionally local access is required to exploit of this issue. Exploitation of this issue only results in a crash of the tcsd daemon which can be restarted. A future update may address this issue.

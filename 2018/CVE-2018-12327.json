	"details": [
		"Stack-based buffer overflow in ntpq and ntpdc of NTP version 4.2.8p11 allows an attacker to achieve code execution or escalate to higher privileges via a long string as the argument for an IPv4 or IPv6 command-line parameter. NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any common situations in which ntpq or ntpdc is used with a command line from an untrusted source.",
		"The ntpq and ntpdc command-line utilities that are part of ntp package are vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow via crafted hostname. Applications using these vulnerable utilities with an untrusted input may be potentially exploited, resulting in a crash or arbitrary code execution under privileges of that application."

		"Curl_smtp_escape_eob in lib/smtp.c in curl 7.54.1 to and including curl 7.60.0 has a heap-based buffer overflow that might be exploitable by an attacker who can control the data that curl transmits over SMTP with certain settings (i.e., use of a nonstandard --limit-rate argument or CURLOPT_BUFFERSIZE value).",
		"A heap-based buffer overflow has been found in the Curl_smtp_escape_eob() function of curl. An attacker could exploit this by convincing a user to use curl to upload data over SMTP with a reduced buffer to cause a crash or corrupt memory."

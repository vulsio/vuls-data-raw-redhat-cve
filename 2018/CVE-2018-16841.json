	"details": [
		"Samba from version 4.3.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 are vulnerable to a denial of service. When configured to accept smart-card authentication, Samba's KDC will call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. This is only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. talloc is robust against further corruption from a double-free with talloc_free() and directly calls abort(), terminating the KDC process.",
		"A double-free was found when Samba's KDC is used as an Active Directory Domain Controller. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash)."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw does not affect the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux because there is no support for samba as Active Directory Domain Controller.",

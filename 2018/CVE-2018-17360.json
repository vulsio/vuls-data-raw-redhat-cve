	"cwe": "CWE-119",
	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. a heap-based buffer over-read in bfd_getl32 in libbfd.c allows an attacker to cause a denial of service through a crafted PE file. This vulnerability can be triggered by the executable objdump."
	],
	"statement": "This issue is classified with a low severity primarily because binutils is not typically exposed to untrusted inputs in most environments, limiting the possibility of exploitation. Additionally, this heap-based buffer over-read is only triggered during the parsing of a specially crafted file, requiring an attacker to convince a user to process this file with objdump. Furthermore, binutils does not handle privileged operations, meaning that exploitation is unlikely to lead to system compromise or escalation of privileges. Also, the impact is limited to the application itself, without affecting the broader system or network security.",

	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root certificate and all system roots on non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain validated certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA (as opposed to one signed by the configured CA root certificate) to authenticate.",
		"A certificate signing vulnerability was found in Moby. This issue could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to validate a TLS certificate using Certificate Authorities (CA) from the system instead of only by a specified client CA root, which could allow bypassing of some certificate authorization rules, reducing system integrity."

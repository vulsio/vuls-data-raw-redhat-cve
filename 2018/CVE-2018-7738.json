	"details": [
		"In util-linux before 2.32-rc1, bash-completion/umount allows local users to gain privileges by embedding shell commands in a mountpoint name, which is mishandled during a umount command (within Bash) by a different user, as demonstrated by logging in as root and entering umount followed by a tab character for autocompletion.",
		"A command injection flaw was found in the way util-linux implements umount autocompletion in Bash. An attacker with the ability to mount a filesystem with custom mount points may execute arbitrary commands on behalf of the user who triggers the umount autocompletion."

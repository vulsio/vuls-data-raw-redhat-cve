	"details": [
		"finish_stab in stabs.c in GNU Binutils 2.30 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by an out-of-bounds write of 8 bytes. This can occur during execution of objdump."
	],
	"statement": "This is a vulnerability affecting binutils, a suite of tools for managing binaries on a linux system; as these tools are used by developers in compilation and debugging, the expected use case is a local user examining object files on a local filesystem, or using ssh to log in. As such, the attack vector is Local, and Privileges Required are Low due to the need for an account on the local machine. Further, there are no impacts to Confidentiality or Integrity, but only to Availability by causing a Denial of Service (crashing the objdump utility). Red Hat Product Security believes this is best reflected by an overall Impact of Low.",

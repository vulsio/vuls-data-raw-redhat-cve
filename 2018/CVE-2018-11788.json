		"Apache Karaf provides a features deployer, which allows users to \"hot deploy\" a features XML by dropping the file directly in the deploy folder. The features XML is parsed by XMLInputFactory class. Apache Karaf XMLInputFactory class doesn't contain any mitigation codes against XXE. This is a potential security risk as an user can inject external XML entities in Apache Karaf version prior to 4.1.7 or 4.2.2. It has been fixed in Apache Karaf 4.1.7 and 4.2.2 releases.",
		"A flaw was found in the Apache Karaf XMLInputFactory, where it does not prevent External Entity Processing (XXE). This is a potential security risk as an attacker could inject external XML entities to access sensitive information or conduct further attacks."

	"statement": "Red Hat OpenStack Platform: Karaf is used by RHOSP's OpenDaylight, and this flaw impacts the loading of XML documents within Karaf, allowing arbitrary XML to be injected into parsed documents. The impact of this vulnerability is reduced in OpenDaylight, given karaf is an administrative component and not normally exposed to public networks or non-privileged users, and therefore will not be fixed at this time.\nFuse 7:\nThe impact of this vulnerability is reduced, as exploiting it would require a authenticated user, and no unsecured endpoints are exposed to the network",

		"The Apache2 component in PHP before 5.6.38, 7.0.x before 7.0.32, 7.1.x before 7.1.22, and 7.2.x before 7.2.10 allows XSS via the body of a \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" request, because the bucket brigade is mishandled in the php_handler function in sapi/apache2handler/sapi_apache2.c.",
		"A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Apache2 component of PHP was found. When using 'Transfer-Encoding: chunked', the request allows remote attackers to potentially run a malicious script in a victim's browser. This vulnerability can be exploited only by producing malformed requests and it's believed it's unlikely to be used in practical cross-site scripting attack."

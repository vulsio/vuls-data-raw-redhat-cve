		"Go before 1.8.7, Go 1.9.x before 1.9.4, and Go 1.10 pre-releases before Go 1.10rc2 allow \"go get\" remote command execution during source code build, by leveraging the gcc or clang plugin feature, because -fplugin= and -plugin= arguments were not blocked.",
		"An arbitrary command execution flaw was found in the way Go's \"go get\" command handled gcc and clang sensitive options during the build. A remote attacker capable of hosting malicious repositories could potentially use this flaw to cause arbitrary command execution on the client side."

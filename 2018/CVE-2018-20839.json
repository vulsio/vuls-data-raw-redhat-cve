	"cwe": "CWE-200",
	"details": [
		"systemd 242 changes the VT1 mode upon a logout, which allows attackers to read cleartext passwords in certain circumstances, such as watching a shutdown, or using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and Ctrl-Alt-F2. This occurs because the KDGKBMODE (aka current keyboard mode) check is mishandled."
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security has determined that exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to physically input keystrokes on the targeted system. The issue results in confidential information being exposed in cleartext, but it does not alter any recorded data, thereby not affecting the system's integrity. Additionally, there is no known method to disrupt the availability of the systemd daemon. Consequently, both the 'Integrity' and 'Availability' impacts are assessed as 'None.'",

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "Red Hat product security does not recommend any workarounds for this bug. To mitigate this vulnerability, users should upgrade to the latest patched version of systemd, where the race condition has been fixed. It's crucial to ensure your system is up-to-date to avoid potential exploitation."

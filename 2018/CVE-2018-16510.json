	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in Artifex Ghostscript before 9.24. Incorrect exec stack handling in the \"CS\" and \"SC\" PDF primitives could be used by remote attackers able to supply crafted PDFs to crash the interpreter or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
		"It was discovered that ghostscript did not properly handle certain error conditions related to the SC and CS PDF operators. An attacker could possibly exploit this to bypass the -dSAFER protection and crash ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the ghostscript context via a specially crafted PostScript document."

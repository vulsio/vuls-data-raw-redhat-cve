	"details": [
		"In Apache Karaf version prior to 3.0.9, 4.0.9, 4.1.1, when the webconsole feature is installed in Karaf, it is available at .../system/console and requires authentication to access it. One part of the console is a Gogo shell/console that gives access to the command line console of Karaf via a Web browser, and when navigated to it is available at .../system/console/gogo. Trying to go directly to that URL does require authentication. And optional bundle that some applications use is the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, it is part of the pax-war feature and perhaps others. When it is installed, the Gogo console becomes available at another URL .../gogo/, and that URL is not secured giving access to the Karaf console to unauthenticated users. A mitigation for the issue is to manually stop/uninstall Gogo plugin bundle that is installed with the webconsole feature, although of course this removes the console from the .../system/console application, not only from the unauthenticated endpoint. One could also stop/uninstall the Pax Web Extender Whiteboard, but other components/applications may require it and so their functionality would be reduced/compromised.",
		"Prior to Karaf 3.0.9, Karaf 4.0.9, and Karaf 4.1.1, HTTP endpoints published by Karaf features may also be published under the HTTP web root, in addition to the paths specifically configured by the installed feature. Authentication and access control rules may not cover this additional path, potentially leading to authentication bypass on published features. The Gogo shell provided by the webconsole feature is potentially accessible without authentication as a result."

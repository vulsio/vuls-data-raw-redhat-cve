	"details": [
		"On a Samba 4 AD DC the LDAP server in all versions of Samba from 4.0.0 onwards incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users' passwords, including administrative users and privileged service accounts (eg Domain Controllers).",
		"A flaw was found in the way Samba AD DC validated user permissions. An authenticated attacker could use this flaw to change any other users passwords, including administrative users."

	"statement": "The versions of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 do not support Active Directory Domain Controller (AD-DC) mode. Therefore this flaw does not affect Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7.",

Note that this will prevent users from being able to change their own expired passwords, so the maximum password age should be set to a value that prevents user passwords from expiring while the workaround is in place.

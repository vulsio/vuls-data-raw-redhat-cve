		"Multiple integer signedness errors in the TIPC implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 allow local users to gain privileges via a crafted sendmsg call that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, related to the tipc_msg_build function in net/tipc/msg.c and the verify_iovec function in net/core/iovec.c."

	"statement": "Red Hat is aware of this issue and is tracking it via the following bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/CVE-2010-3859.\nThis issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for Transparent Inter-Process Communication Protocol (TIPC). A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 may address this flaw. As a\npreventive measure, we plan to include the fixes in a future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.",

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "For users that do not run applications that use TIPC, you can prevent the TIPC\nmodule from being loaded by adding the following entry to the end of the\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file:\nblacklist tipc\nThis way, the TIPC module cannot be loaded accidentally, which may occur if an\napplication that requires TIPC is started. A reboot is not necessary for this\nchange to take effect but do make sure the module is not loaded in the first\nplace. You can verify that by running:\nlsmod | grep tipc\nYou may also consider removing the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability from the current\nglobal capability set to prevent kernel modules from being loaded or unloaded.\nThe CAP_SYS_MODULE has a capability number of 16 (see linux/capability.h). The\ndefault value has all the bits set. To remove this capability, you have to\nclear the 16th bit of the default 32-bit value, e.g. 0xffffff ^ (1 << 16):\necho 0xFFFEFFFF > /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound"

	"details": [
		"The processcompl_compat function in drivers/usb/core/devio.c in Linux kernel 2.6.x through 2.6.32, and possibly other versions, does not clear the transfer buffer before returning to userspace when a USB command fails, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory)."

	"statement": "This issue has been rated as having low security impact.\nA future update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this flaw. This issue is not planned to be fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, due to this product being in Production 3 of its maintenance life-cycle, where only qualified security errata of important or critical impact are addressed.\nFor further information about Errata Support Policy, visit: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/",

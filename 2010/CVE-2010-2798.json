	"details": [
		"The gfs2_dirent_find_space function in fs/gfs2/dir.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35 uses an incorrect size value in calculations associated with sentinel directory entries, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) and possibly have unspecified other impact by renaming a file in a GFS2 filesystem, related to the gfs2_rename function in fs/gfs2/ops_inode.c."

	"statement": "This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 3, 4 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include\nsupport for the GFS2 file system.\nA future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 will address this issue.",

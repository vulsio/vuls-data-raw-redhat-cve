		"The iowarrior_write function in drivers/usb/misc/iowarrior.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 does not properly allocate memory, which might allow local users to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, and consequently cause a denial of service or gain privileges, via a long report."

	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they do not have support for the I/O-Warrior USB devices. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html. A future kernel update in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw.",

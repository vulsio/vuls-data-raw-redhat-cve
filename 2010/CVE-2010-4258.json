		"The do_exit function in kernel/exit.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 does not properly handle a KERNEL_DS get_fs value, which allows local users to bypass intended access_ok restrictions, overwrite arbitrary kernel memory locations, and gain privileges by leveraging a (1) BUG, (2) NULL pointer dereference, or (3) page fault, as demonstrated by vectors involving the clear_child_tid feature and the splice system call."
	],
	"statement": "The Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG enabled the panic_on_oops sysctl tunable by default, and therefore are not affected by this issue. However, as a preventive measure (for example, for administrators who have turned panic_on_oops off), this issue was fixed in kernel updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG. Because the fix was considered as a preventative measure, this CVE is not listed in the related advisories that provided the fix: RHSA-2011:0162, RHSA-2011:0263, RHSA-2011:0017, RHSA-2011:0498, RHSA-2011:0542, RHSA-2011:0330. The fix is documented in each of these advisories as a regular bug fix, for example as BZ#659568 in RHSA-2011:0162.",

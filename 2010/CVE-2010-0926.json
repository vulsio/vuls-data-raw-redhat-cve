		"The default configuration of smbd in Samba before 3.3.11, 3.4.x before 3.4.6, and 3.5.x before 3.5.0rc3, when a writable share exists, allows remote authenticated users to leverage a directory traversal vulnerability, and access arbitrary files, by using the symlink command in smbclient to create a symlink containing .. (dot dot) sequences, related to the combination of the unix extensions and wide links options."
	],
	"statement": "This issue was addressed in Samba packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. It did not affect Samba packages in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact. There is no plan to address this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.\nTo prevent this issue, disable \"wide links\" or \"unix extensions\" in the Samba configuration file (/etc/samba/smb.conf) and restart smbd (service smb restart). Disabled \"wide links\" ensure that remote Samba clients will not have wide symbolic links (links pointing outside of the shared directory) resolved on the server side when processing requests from a client that does not support UNIX extensions. Disabled \"unix extensions\" prevents creation of wide links by malicious clients which support UNIX extensions.

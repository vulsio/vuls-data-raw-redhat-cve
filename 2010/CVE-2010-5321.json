		"Memory leak in drivers/media/video/videobuf-core.c in the videobuf subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.x through 4.x allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by leveraging /dev/video access for a series of mmap calls that require new allocations, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-6761.  NOTE: as of 2016-06-18, this affects only 11 drivers that have not been updated to use videobuf2 instead of videobuf."

	"statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. This issue does affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.\nBased on the absence of upstream patch addressing this issue in VIDEOBUF (newer drivers using VIDEOBUF2 are not affected) implementation and that Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact, this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future kernel updates for the respective releases.

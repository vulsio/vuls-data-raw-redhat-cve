		"The gfs2_lock function in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34-rc1-next-20100312, and the gfs_lock function in the Linux kernel on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and 6, does not properly remove POSIX locks on files that are setgid without group-execute permission, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) by locking a file on a (1) GFS or (2) GFS2 filesystem, and then changing this file's permissions."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG, as it did not include support for the GFS and GFS2 file systems.\nFor the GFS issue, it was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3 in the gfs package, 4 in the GFS-kernel package, and 5 in the gfs-kmod package, via RHSA-2010:9493, RHSA-2010:9494, RHSA-2010:0291 respectively.\nFor the GFS2 issue, it was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 in the kernel package via RHSA-2010:0178.",

		"Heap-based buffer overflow in the bcm_connect function in net/can/bcm.c (aka the Broadcast Manager) in the Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 on 64-bit platforms might allow local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a connect operation."

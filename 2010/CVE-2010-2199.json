	"details": [
		"lib/fsm.c in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly reset the metadata of an executable file during replacement of the file in an RPM package upgrade or deletion of the file in an RPM package removal, which might allow local users to bypass intended access restrictions by creating a hard link to a vulnerable file that has a POSIX ACL, a related issue to CVE-2010-2059."
	],
	"statement": "We do not consider RPM's lack of removing POSIX ACLs to be security sensitive.  Users cannot use POSIX ACLs to elevate their privileges; therefore, there is no need to clear them upon package upgrade or removal.",

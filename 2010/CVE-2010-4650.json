	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped with Red\nHat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not backport the upstream commit\n59efec7b that introduced this issue. It did not affect the version of Linux\nkernel as shipped with Red hat Enterprise MRG as it did not provide support\nfor Character device in Userspace (CUSE). A future kernel update in Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 6 may address this flaw. Note that, by default, the\n\"/dev/cuse\" file in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is only accessible by the\nroot user.",

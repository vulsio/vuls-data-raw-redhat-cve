		"transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when a world-writable sticky-bit mail directory is used, does not verify the st_nlink field of mailbox files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by creating a hard link to another user's file."
	],
	"statement": "The Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact.  By default, /var/spool/mail/ is not provided with permissions to make an attack scenario possible, and there is no reason for permissions to be relaxed in such a way as to make it possible.  We therefore have no plans to fix this flaw in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 or 5.",

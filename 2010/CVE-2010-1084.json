	"details": [
		"Linux kernel 2.6.18 through 2.6.33, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a large number of Bluetooth sockets, related to the size of sysfs files in (1) net/bluetooth/l2cap.c, (2) net/bluetooth/rfcomm/core.c, (3) net/bluetooth/rfcomm/sock.c, and (4) net/bluetooth/sco.c."

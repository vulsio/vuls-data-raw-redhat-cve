	"details": [
		"The ACPI subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 uses 0222 permissions for the debugfs custom_method file, which allows local users to gain privileges by placing a custom ACPI method in the ACPI interpreter tables, related to the acpi_debugfs_init function in drivers/acpi/debugfs.c."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 4, 5, and 6 as they did not include upstream commit a1a541d8 and a25ee920 that introduced the problem. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-0330.html.\nNotes:\nThis requires debugfs to be mounted on a local system in order to have access to the custom_method file. Debugfs is not mounted by default. You need to run \"mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug\" as root first.",

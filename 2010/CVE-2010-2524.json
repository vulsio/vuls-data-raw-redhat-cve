		"The DNS resolution functionality in the CIFS implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35, when CONFIG_CIFS_DFS_UPCALL is enabled, relies on a user's keyring for the dns_resolver upcall in the cifs.upcall userspace helper, which allows local users to spoof the results of DNS queries and perform arbitrary CIFS mounts via vectors involving an add_key call, related to a \"cache stuffing\" issue and MS-DFS referrals."

	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not include support for the upcall mechanism for the Common Internet File System (CIFS).

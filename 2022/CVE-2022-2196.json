		"A regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed for speculative execution attacks. L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks on L1 due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after running L2 due to KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An attacker at L2 with code execution can execute code on an indirect branch on the host machine. We recommend upgrading to Kernel 6.2 or past commit 2e7eab81425a",
		"A flaw was found in the KVM's Intel nested virtualization feature (nVMX). Since L1 and L2 shared branch prediction modes (guest-user and guest-kernel), KVM did not protect indirect branches in L1 from steering by a malicious agent in L2. This could allow a malicious nested guest to carry out Spectre v2 attacks against L1 due to a missing IBPB at VM-exit time."

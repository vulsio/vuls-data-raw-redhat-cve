	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in pki-core, which could allow a user to get a certificate for another user identity when directory-based authentication is enabled.

This flaw allows an authenticated attacker on the adjacent network to impersonate another user within the scope of the domain, but they would not be able to decrypt message content."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw is rated Moderate because the configuration setting that makes pki-core vulnerable - directory-based authentication - is disabled by default and the damage is somewhat limited to the domain where the ids are recognized (for example, in one corporation's realm).",

	"details": [
		"The hardware emulation in the of_dpa_cmd_add_l2_flood of rocker device model in QEMU, as used in 7.0.0 and earlier, allows remote attackers to crash the host qemu and potentially execute code on the host via execute a malformed program in the guest OS.",
		"A NULL pointer dereference bug was found in the rocker device (emulated ethernet switch) of QEMU. The rocker_tlv_parse_nested() function could return early because of no group ids in the group_tlvs array. In such case, the tlvs pointer is NULL and tlvs[i + 1] in the next for-loop iteration ends up dereferencing a NULL pointer."
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux and RHEL Advanced Virtualization are not affected by this bug, as the rocker device is not built and shipped with Red Hat `qemu-kvm` packages. Also, according to the QEMU upstream security guidelines [1] Red Hat Product Security does not consider this to be a vulnerability because it does not fall under the Virtualization Use Case; the rocker device is mainly used in development environments where the guest is assumed to be trusted.\n[1] https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/security.html",

		"Integer overflow vulnerability in pcre2test before 10.41 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or other unspecified impacts via negative input.",
		"A flaw was found in PCRE2, where it is susceptible to an integer overflow vulnerability triggered by a negative repeat value in the pcre2test subject line that causes infinite looping. This flaw allows a remote attacker to pass specially crafted data to the application, initiating an integer overflow and executing a denial of service (DoS) attack."

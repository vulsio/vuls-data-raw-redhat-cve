	"cwe": "CWE-77",
	"details": [
		"BusyBox through 1.35.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code if netstat is used to print a DNS PTR record's value to a VT compatible terminal. Alternatively, the attacker could choose to change the terminal's colors.",
		"An escape sequence injection attack was found in BusyBox on Alpine. For this issue to occur, a remote host's virtual terminal must contain an escape sequence, and the victim must then execute netstat. This flaw allows an attacker can inject arbitrary code, leading to a loss of integrity."

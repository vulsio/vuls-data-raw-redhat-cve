		"Versions affected: BIND 9.18.0 When a vulnerable version of named receives a series of specific queries, the named process will eventually terminate due to a failed assertion check.",
		"An assertion check flaw was found in BIND, with a refactoration of RFC 8198 Aggressive Use of the DNSSEC-Validated Cache feature (synth-from-dnssec). The repeated patterns of specific queries to servers with this feature enabled could cause an INSIST failure in query.c:query_dname, which results in unexpected termination. This flaw allows a remote attacker to use a series of specific queries to trigger a failed assertion check that causes the named process to terminate, leading to a denial of service."

	"statement": "The vulnerability affects BIND resolvers running 9.18.0 with both dnssec-validation and synth-from-dnssec enabled. (Note that dnssec-validation auto; is the default setting unless configured otherwise in named.conf and that enabling dnssec-validation automatically enables synth-from-dnssec unless explicitly disabled) \nThis flaw only affects BIND-9.18.0, whereas Red Hat ships BIND-9.16 and lower versions. Therefore, versions of BIND shipped with Red Hat Products are not affected by this flaw.",

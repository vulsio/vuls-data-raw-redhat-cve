	"details": [
		"Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0530.",
		"A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's movemark() function of the src/mark.c file. This issue occurs because vim uses freed memory when 'autocmd' changes the mark. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

		"NULL Pointer Dereference in function vim_regexec_string at regexp.c:2733 in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4938. NULL Pointer Dereference in function vim_regexec_string at regexp.c:2733 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted input.",
		"A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in vim's vim_regexec_string() function in regexp.c file. The issue occurs when the function tries to match the buffer with an invalid pattern. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a NULL pointer dereference that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service."

	"statement": "All versions of Vim shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are not affected, because no vulnerable code is present in our code-base.\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization 4 consumes RHEL-8 vim, and as RHEL-8 is not affected, Hence, RHEV is also not affected.\nRed Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low-security impact because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",

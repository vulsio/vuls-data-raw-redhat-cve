		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\nnet/mlx5: DR, Fix slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte\nWhen adding a rule with 32 destinations, we hit the following out-of-band\naccess issue:\nBUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte+0x18ee/0x1e70\nThis patch fixes the issue by both increasing the allocated buffers to\naccommodate for the needed actions and by checking the number of actions\nto prevent this issue when a rule with too many actions is provided.",
		"A vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's Ethernet fs_dr.c driver in the mlx5_cmd_dr_create_fte() function, where a slab-out-of-bounds can occur. This flaw is caused by how the driver allocates and manages memory when dealing with flow rules actions. A rule can have up to 32 destinations, but additional actions can also be stored in the same buffer used for destinations. The out-of-bounds access occurs when the allocated buffer size is insufficiently sized to contain all possible actions (more than 32), potentially leading to memory corruption or system instability."

	"statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux is not impacted by this CVE, as the vulnerability in question does not affect the specific versions or configurations of the Linux kernel used in its distributions. This ensures that users of Red Hat Enterprise Linux are not exposed to the potential risks associated with this issue and no further action or mitigation is necessary for systems running this operating system.",

	"details": [
		"In certain situations it is possible for an unmanaged rule to exist on the target system that has the same comment as the rule specified in the manifest. This could allow for unmanaged rules to exist on the target system and leave the system in an unsafe state.",
		"A flaw was found in the Puppet Firewall module. In certain situations, an unmanaged rule can exist on the target system that has the same comment as a rule specified in the manifest. When this condition is true, Puppet will ignore the unmanaged rule and continue to apply the rule in the manifest. This issue occurs because the firewall module uses the comment field in IPT as its namevar and therefore expects it to be a unique identifier. In the case of IPT, this is not true, given that you can have multiple rules with the same comment."

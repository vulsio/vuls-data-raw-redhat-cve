	"details": [
		"A heap-based buffer overflow was found in the Linux kernel's LightNVM subsystem. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. This vulnerability allows a local attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel. The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.",

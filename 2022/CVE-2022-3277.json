		"An uncontrolled resource consumption flaw was found in openstack-neutron. This flaw allows a remote authenticated user to query a list of security groups for an invalid project. This issue creates resources that are unconstrained by the user's quota. If a malicious user were to submit a significant number of requests, this could lead to a denial of service.",

	],
	"statement": "While this vulnerability triggers the usage of API and Database resources, there is no action taken by OpenStack to enforce these new security group rules. As a result, the impact of this Denial of Service is rather limited. So deployments that have a strong trust relationship with all users (such as a private or company-internal OpenStack service) can consider this flaw as having a Low impact. Additionally, this vulnerability only affects deployments which provide direct access to their application programming interface (API). The command line interface (CLI) has had protections against this kind of misuse since at least Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.",

	"details": [
		"global heap buffer overflow in skip_range in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 8.2.4763. This vulnerability is capable of crashing software, Bypass Protection Mechanism, Modify Memory, and possible remote execution",
		"A global heap buffer overflow vulnerability was found in vim's skip_range() function of the src/ex_docmd.c file. This flaw occurs because vim uses an invalid pointer with \"V:\" in Ex mode. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap buffer overflow that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service."

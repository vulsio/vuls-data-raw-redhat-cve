	"statement": "Some releases of Red Hat OpenStack Platform ship an affected version of the Erlang libraries, however RHOSP is configured to use application-level shared secret authentication during TLS sessions.

For this reason the impact to Red Hat OpenStack Platform has been downgraded to Moderate.",

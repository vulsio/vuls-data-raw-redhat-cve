		"Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. In versions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and enabled afterwards, as the migrations which are translating legacy folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario where the only user permission in the folder is Admin, as a result RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions manually.",
		"A flaw was found in Grafana. This vulnerability impacts folders/dashboards with Admin-only permissions and where role-based access control (RBAC) was ever enabled at least once. When RBAC is enabled, Grafana runs migrations that translate legacy access control permissions into RBAC permissions. The migrations contain a bug, which grants additional access to folders/dashboards that only had the Admin role grant, resulting in a privilege escalation where Editors can edit and Viewers can view the folder/dashboard to which they should not have access."

		"containerd is a container runtime available as a daemon for Linux and Windows. A bug was found in containerd prior to versions 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.14.12 where containers launched through containerd’s CRI implementation on Linux with a specially-crafted image configuration could gain access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host. This may bypass any policy-based enforcement on container setup (including a Kubernetes Pod Security Policy) and expose potentially sensitive information. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use containerd’s CRI implementation. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.1, 1.5.10, and 1.4.12. Users should update to these versions to resolve the issue.",
		"An information leak was discovered in containerd. This issue could allow a remote attacker access to read-only copies of arbitrary files and directories on the host, which can be exploited with a specially-crafted image configuration."

	"statement": "For several Red Hat products containerd is shipped but cri-o (which is not affected by this flaw) is used by default. For this reason, the impact has been downgraded to Low.",

		"Use After Free in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.0260.",
		"A heap use-after-free vulnerability was found in vim's qf_fill_buffer() function of the src/quickfix.c file. The issue occurs because vim uses freed memory when recursively using 'quickfixtextfunc.' This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering a heap use-after-free that causes an application to crash, possibly executing code and corrupting memory."

	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.",

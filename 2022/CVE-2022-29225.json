		"Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to 1.22.1 secompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This may allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small highly compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling decompression.",
		"A flaw was found in Envoy. A specifically constructed HTTP body delivered by an untrusted downstream or upstream peer whose decompressed size is dramatically larger than the compressed size can be sent by an attacker to cause a denial of service."

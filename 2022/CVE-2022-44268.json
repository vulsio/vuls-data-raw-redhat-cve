	"cwe": "CWE-200",
	"details": [
		"ImageMagick 7.1.0-49 is vulnerable to Information Disclosure. When it parses a PNG image (e.g., for resize), the resulting image could have embedded the content of an arbitrary. file (if the magick binary has permissions to read it).",
		"An information disclosure vulnerability was found in ImageMagick. This flaw allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from a server when parsing an image and happens when the program is parsing a PNG image. If ImageMagick has permission to read other arbitrary files, the resulting image could have been embedded with contents from another file on the machine after the parsing process."

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "To mitigate the issue, we recommend setting a security policy that is suitable for your local environment. Add this to your security policy (policy.xml):\n~~~\n<policy domain=\"path\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"/etc/*\"/>  <!-- don't read sensitive paths -->\n~~~\nWith above policy, you get:\n~~~\n$ magick logo: -set profile /etc/passwd logo.png\nmagick: attempt to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy `/etc/passwd' @ error/blob.c/FileToBlob/1433.\n~~~\nThis can be as draconian as needed. Use /* as the path to prevent reading any file with an absolute path. You can also protect against relative paths:\n~~~\n<policy domain=\"path\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"../*\"/>\n~~~\n(For more information, refer to the complete issue discussion in external references)"

		"A vulnerability was found in Linux Kernel. It has been classified as problematic. This affects the function find_prog_by_sec_insn of the file tools/lib/bpf/libbpf.c of the component BPF. The manipulation leads to null pointer dereference. It is recommended to apply a patch to fix this issue. The identifier VDB-211749 was assigned to this vulnerability.",
		"A flaw was found in libbpf. When there are no program sections, obj->programs is left unallocated, causing a NULL pointer dereference in the following access to prog->sec_idx in find_prog_by_sec_insn. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service."

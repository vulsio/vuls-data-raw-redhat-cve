		"id": "426548",
		"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=426548"
	},
	"details": [
		"Apache HTTP Server, when running on Linux with a document root on a Windows share mounted using smbfs, allows remote attackers to obtain unprocessed content such as source files for .php programs via a trailing \"\\\" (backslash), which is not handled by the intended AddType directive."
	],
	"statement": "Old versions of the Linux 2.4 kernel allowed the lookup of names containing backslashes over smbfs -- so there were multiple names which would reference any particular file, allowing the bypass of Apache controls such as AddType.\nNot vulnerable. This issue did not affect the versions of the Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, 4, or 5. This issue was corrected with a backported patch for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1 by RHSA-2007:0672.\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2007-6514",

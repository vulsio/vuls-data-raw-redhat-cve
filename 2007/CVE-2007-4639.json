		"EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 8.2 does not properly handle certain debugging function calls that occur before a call to pldbg_create_listener, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SELECT statement that invokes a pldbg_ function, as demonstrated by (1) pldbg_get_stack and (2) pldbg_abort_target, which triggers use of an uninitialized pointer."

		"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=243702"
	},
	"details": [
		"sudo, when linked with MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5), does not properly check whether a user can currently authenticate to Kerberos, which allows local users to gain privileges, in a manner unintended by the sudo security model, via certain KRB5_ environment variable settings.  NOTE: another researcher disputes this vulnerability, stating that the attacker must be \"a user, who can already log into your system, and can already use sudo.\""
	],
	"statement": "Not vulnerable. Versions of sudo package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 2.1, 3, 4 and 5 are linked with PAM support and never use libkrb5 authentication.",

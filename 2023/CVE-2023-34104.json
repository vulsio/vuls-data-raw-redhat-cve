	"details": [
		"fast-xml-parser is an open source, pure javascript xml parser. fast-xml-parser allows special characters in entity names, which are not escaped or sanitized. Since the entity name is used for creating a regex for searching and replacing entities in the XML body, an attacker can abuse it for denial of service (DoS) attacks. By crafting an entity name that results in an intentionally bad performing regex and utilizing it in the entity replacement step of the parser, this can cause the parser to stall for an indefinite amount of time. This problem has been resolved in v4.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by setting the `processEntities: false` option.",
		"A flaw was found in the fast-XML-parser. The affected versions of fast-XML-parser are vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in the Doctype Entities. By sending a specially crafted regex input, a remote attacker can cause a denial of service condition."

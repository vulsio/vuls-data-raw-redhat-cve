		"Jenkins Template Workflows Plugin 41.v32d86a_313b_4a and earlier does not escape names of jobs used as buildings blocks for Template Workflow Job, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create jobs.",
		"A flaw was found in the Jenkins Template Workflows Plugin, where it is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting caused by the improper validation of user-supplied input. This flaw allows a remote, authenticated attacker to inject malicious script into a Web page, which would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the page is viewed, and steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."

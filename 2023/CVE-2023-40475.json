		"A heap buffer overflow flaw was found in the MXF file, demuxer, in the GStreamer Plugins Bad when handling malformed files with AES3 audio. This issue requires user interaction with the library. It may allow a malicious user to cause an integer overflow before allocating the buffer, triggering a crash or code execution via heap manipulation, and executing code in the context of the current process."

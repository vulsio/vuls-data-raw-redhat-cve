	"cwe": "CWE-200",
	"details": [
		"Multiple NSS NIST curves were susceptible to a side-channel attack known as \"Minerva\". This attack could potentially allow an attacker to recover the private key. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 121.",
		"The Network Security Services (NSS) package contains a vulnerability that exposes a side-channel information leak. This weakness enables a local attacker to capture several thousand usages of a signature, allowing them to utilize this information to recover portions of an ECDSA private key."
	],
	"statement": "The severity of the Network Security Services (NSS) package vulnerability is marked as important due to the inherent risk associated with a potential side-channel information leak. This flaw empowers a local attacker to capture a substantial volume of signature usages, providing a pathway for them to exploit this data to reconstruct portions of an ECDSA private key. The ECDSA private key is a fundamental component of cryptographic security, and a successful compromise could have severe implications for the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information.",

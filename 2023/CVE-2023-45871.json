	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel before 6.5.3. A buffer size may not be adequate for frames larger than the MTU.",
		"A flaw was found in igb_configure_rx_ring in drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igb/igb_main.c in the IGB driver in the Linux kernel. An overflow of the contents from a packet that is too large will overflow into the kernel's ring buffer, leading to a system integrity issue."

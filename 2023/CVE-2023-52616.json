		"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\ncrypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init\nWhen the mpi_ec_ctx structure is initialized, some fields are not\ncleared, causing a crash when referencing the field when the\nstructure was released. Initially, this issue was ignored because\nmemory for mpi_ec_ctx is allocated with the __GFP_ZERO flag.\nFor example, this error will be triggered when calculating the\nZa value for SM2 separately.",
		"A vulnerability was found in the crypto: lib/mpi component of the Linux kernel, where the initialization of the mpi_ec_ctx structure caused crashes due to uncleared fields. This issue occurs when the structure is referenced after being released. It typically triggers during specific calculations, like the Za value for SM2."

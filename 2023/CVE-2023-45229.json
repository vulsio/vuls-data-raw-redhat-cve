	"details": [
		"A vulnerability has been identified in the NetworkPkg IP stack of EDK2, the open-source reference implementation of the UEFI specification. This flaw enables an unauthenticated attacker within the same network vicinity to transmit a specifically crafted DHCPv6 message. Exploiting this vulnerability may result in unauthorized access to memory beyond its boundaries, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive information."
	],
	"statement": "The identified flaw in the NetworkPkg IP stack within the EDK2, an open-source UEFI implementation, poses a moderate security concern. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker within the same network to exploit via a crafted DHCPv6 message, potentially leading to the unauthorized access of memory beyond its designated boundaries. While the issue has the potential to leak sensitive information, its impact is considered moderate, requiring an attacker to be within the adjacent network for successful exploitation.",

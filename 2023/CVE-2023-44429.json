	"details": [
		"A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in GStreamer in the AV1 codec parser when handling certain malformed streams. A malicious third party could use this flaw to trigger a crash in the application and possibly affect code execution through heap manipulation."
	],
	"statement": "A malicious third party has the potential to induce a crash in the application and may also impact code execution by manipulating the heap. Additionally, this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access and compromise the security of the system.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 7 & 8 has gstreamer < 1.17 which does not have the av1 parser yet(does not have the vulnerable code), so RHEL-7 & RHEL-8 is not affected by this CVE.",

		"Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. Prior to versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12, the CORS filter will segfault and crash Envoy when the `origin` header is removed and deleted between `decodeHeaders`and `encodeHeaders`. Versions 1.27.0, 1.26.4, 1.25.9, 1.24.10, and 1.23.12 have a fix for this issue. As a workaround, do not remove the `origin` header in the Envoy configuration.",
		"A flaw was found in Envoy. Suppose an origin header is configured to be removed with request_headers_to_remove: origin. The CORS filter will segfault and crash Envoy when the origin header is removed and deleted between decodeHeaders and encodeHeaders."

	"details": [
		"Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier creates a temporary file in the system temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files when installing a plugin from a URL, potentially allowing attackers with access to the system temporary directory to replace the file before it is installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
		"A flaw was found in Jenkins weekly and LTS due to an issue creating a temporary file in the system's temporary directory with default permissions. By sending a specially crafted request, a local authenticated attacker could execute arbitrary code on the system."

	"statement": "Red Hat Build of Quarkus flaw happens because the cookie contains a token that token could potentially be more useful to attackers than a normal session cookie hijacking attack. Other potentially higher security applications may accept the same token from the cookie, while with a normal session hijacking attack it is limited to the application that issued the cookie.\nAn attacker needs to have compromised a significant amount of your infrastructure to get the cookie. For this reason, the flaw is rated Low impact",

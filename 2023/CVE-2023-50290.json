	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in Apache Solr. This issue may allow an unauthorized actor access to sensitive information. The Solr Metrics API publishes all unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr instance. Users are able to specify which environment variables to hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret Java system properties. Environment variables cannot be strictly defined in Solr like Java system properties can be, and may be set for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set per-Java-proccess."

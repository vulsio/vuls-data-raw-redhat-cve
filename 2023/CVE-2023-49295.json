	"cwe": "CWE-400",
	"details": [
		"A memory exhaustion vulnerability was found in Quic-GO, where a malicious client exploits the path validation mechanism to induce the server into accumulating an unbounded queue of PATH_RESPONSE frames, depleting its memory. The attacker controls the victim's packet send rate by overwhelming the server with numerous packets containing PATH_CHALLENGE frames. Through selective acknowledgments of received packets and manipulation of peer's Round-Trip Time (RTT) estimates, the attacker induces congestion control mechanisms to reduce the server's send rate significantly. Consequently, the victim server is compelled to store an increasing number of queued PATH_RESPONSE frames, resulting in memory exhaustion."

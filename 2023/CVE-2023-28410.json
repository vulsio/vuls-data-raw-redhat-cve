		"Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer in some Intel(R) i915 Graphics drivers for linux before kernel version 6.2.10 may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access.",
		"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel i915 graphics driver that improperly restricts operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. This issue could allow a local user to crash the system or potentially escalate their privileges on the system."

		"value": "Preventing loading the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system; however, the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See the kcs “How do I blacklist a kernel module to prevent it from loading automatically?“  (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module from autoloading. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.\nThis mitigation may not be suitable if the graphical login functionality is required."

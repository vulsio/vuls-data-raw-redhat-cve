	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in some SMTP server configurations in Sendmail. This issue may allow a remote attacker to break out of the email message data to \"smuggle\" SMTP commands and send spoofed emails that pass SPF checks."
	],
	"statement": "The Sendmail vulnerability allowing SMTP smuggling is deemed moderate due to its impact on SPF protection mechanisms and specific conditions for successful exploitation. SMTP smuggling involves manipulating the communication between mail servers to inject unauthorized messages. Exploiting this flaw involves a technique where remote attackers inject email messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address. This manipulation allows them to bypass SPF protections because Sendmail supports the <LF>.<CR><LF> sequence, which some other popular email servers do not.",

	"details": [
		"Jenkins 2.50 through 2.423 (both inclusive), LTS 2.60.1 through 2.414.1 (both inclusive) does not exclude sensitive build variables (e.g., password parameter values) from the search in the build history widget, allowing attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain values of sensitive variables used in builds by iteratively testing different characters until the correct sequence is discovered.",
		"A flaw was found in Jenkins weekly and LTS caused by not excluding sensitive build variables when filtering builds in the build history widget. By sending a specially crafted request, a remote,  authenticated attacker could obtain values of sensitive variables used in builds and use this information to launch further attacks against the affected system."

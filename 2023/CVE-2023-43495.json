	"details": [
		"Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier does not escape the value of the 'caption' constructor parameter of 'ExpandableDetailsNote', resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control this parameter.",
		"A flaw was found in Jenkins weekly and LTS, which are vulnerable to cross-site scripting caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by the caption constructor parameter of ExpandableDetailsNote. This issue could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to inject malicious script into a Web page, which would be executed in a victim's Web browser in the hosting Web site, and then steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."

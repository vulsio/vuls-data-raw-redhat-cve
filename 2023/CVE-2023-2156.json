	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in the networking subsystem of the Linux kernel within the handling of the RPL protocol. This issue results from the lack of proper handling of user-supplied data, which can lead to an assertion failure. This may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to create a denial of service condition on the system.",

	"statement": "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 are not affected by this flaw as they did not include RPL source routing support (upstream commit 8610c7c \"net: ipv6: add support for rpl sr exthdr\"). The flaw cannot be triggered if the `rpl_seg_enabled` sysctl is set to 0. Please note that the `rpl_seg_enabled` sysctl is not enabled by default in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9. As such, the impact has been lowered to Moderate on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.",

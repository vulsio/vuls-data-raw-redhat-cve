	"statement": "This is a hardware flaw that affects select Intel processors and is not a Red Hat Enterprise Linux defect/vulnerability - no Red Hat products are affected by this CVE. Red Hat has very limited to no visibility and control over binary blobs provided by third-party vendors. Red Hat relies heavily on the vendors to provide timely updates and information about included changes for this content. In most cases, it merely acts as a release vehicle between the third-party vendor and Red Hat customers with no possibility of influencing or even documenting the changes. Unless explicitly stated, the level of insight, oversight, and control Red Hat has does not meet the criteria required (in terms of Red Hat-owned development processes and QA documentation) for releasing this content as RHSA.

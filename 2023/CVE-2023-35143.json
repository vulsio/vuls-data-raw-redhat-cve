	"details": [
		"Jenkins Maven Repository Server Plugin 1.10 and earlier does not escape the versions of build artifacts on the Build Artifacts As Maven Repository page, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control maven project versions in `pom.xml`.",
		"A flaw was found in the Jenkins Maven Repository Server Plugin, where it is vulnerable to Cross-site scripting caused by the improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote, authenticated attacker can inject malicious script into a web page, which would be executed in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the page is viewed. This flaw allows an attacker to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."

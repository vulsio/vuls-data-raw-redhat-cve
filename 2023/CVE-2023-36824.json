		"Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. In Redit 7.0 prior to 7.0.12, extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption and potentially remote code execution. Several scenarios that may lead to authenticated users executing a specially crafted `COMMAND GETKEYS` or `COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS`and authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, executing a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names. The vulnerability is patched in Redis 7.0.12.",
		"A heap overflow vulnerability was found in Redis, where extracting key names from a command and a list of arguments may, in some cases, trigger a heap overflow and result in reading random heap memory, heap corruption, and potentially remote code execution. This flaw allows an attacker to trick authenticated users into executing a specially crafted COMMAND GETKEYS or COMMAND GETKEYSANDFLAGS and also trick authenticated users who were set with ACL rules that match key names, to execute a specially crafted command that refers to a variadic list of key names."

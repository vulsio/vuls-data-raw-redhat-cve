	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in the function gdev_prn_open_printer_seekable() in Artifex Ghostscript through 10.02.0 allows remote attackers to crash the application via a dangling pointer.",
		"A flaw was found in Ghostscript. A remote attacker may use a specially crafted payload to trigger access to previously freed memory, which can potentially lead to remote code execution or an application crash."
	],
	"statement": "The discovered vulnerability in the function gdev_prn_open_printer_seekable() within Artifex Ghostscript, poses a moderate severity threat due to its potential to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Exploiting this flaw involves manipulating a dangling pointer, which can lead to crashing the application. While the impact is limited to crashing the application, the exploit requires remote access, which elevates the risk compared to local-only vulnerabilities.",

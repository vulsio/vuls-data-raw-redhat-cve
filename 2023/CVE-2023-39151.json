	"details": [
		"Jenkins 2.415 and earlier, LTS 2.401.2 and earlier does not sanitize or properly encode URLs in build logs when transforming them into hyperlinks, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control build log contents.",
		"A flaw was found in Jenkins, where Jenkins weekly and LTS are vulnerable to Cross-site scripting caused by the improper validation of user-supplied input. A remote, authenticated attacker can inject malicious script into a web page, which would be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the page is viewed. This flaw allows an attacker to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."

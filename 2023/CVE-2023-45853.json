		"MiniZip in zlib through 1.3 has an integer overflow and resultant heap-based buffer overflow in zipOpenNewFileInZip4_64 via a long filename, comment, or extra field. NOTE: MiniZip is not a supported part of the zlib product.",
		"A flaw was found in the MiniZip component of the zlib package. When opening a new file, MiniZip doesn't properly validate the filename, comments, or extra fields length against the data type used to store this information. This may allow an attacker to craft a malicious ZIP file that will lead to an overflow on the length field. This value is further used in memory allocations and indexing, which can cause an out-of-bounds write, leading to heap corruption and possible arbitrary code execution."

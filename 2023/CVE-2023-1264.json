		"NULL Pointer Dereference in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1392.",
		"A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was discovered in vim's utfc_ptr2len() function in the mbyte.c file. This issue is due to using a NULL pointer with the nested :open command. This flaw allows an attacker to trick a user into opening a specially crafted file, triggering an issue that causes an application to crash, leading to a denial of service."

	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a Low security impact, because the \"victim\" has to run an untrusted file IN SCRIPT MODE. Someone who is running untrusted files in script mode is equivalent to someone just taking a random python script and running it.\nSince Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 are Out-of-Support-Scope for Low/Moderate flaws, the issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates for RHEL-6,7. Only Important and Critical severity flaws will be addressed at this time.\nFor additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/ and Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle & Updates Policy: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.",

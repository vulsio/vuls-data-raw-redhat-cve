	"cwe": "CWE-755",
	"details": [
		"There exists a vulnerability in source code transformer (exception sanitization logic) of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.15, allowing attackers to bypass `handleException()` and leak unsanitized host exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context. A threat actor can bypass the sandbox protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.16` of `vm2`.",
		"A flaw was found in the vm2 sandbox. When exception handling is triggered, the sanitization logic is not managed with proper exception handling. This issue may allow an attacker to bypass the sandbox protections which can lead to remote code execution on the hypervisor host or the host which is running the sandbox."

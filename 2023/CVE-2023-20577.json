	"details": [
		"A vulnerability was found in AMD hardware due to a heap overflow in the SMM module. This issue could allow a local unauthenticated attacker to enable writing to SPI flash to execute arbitrary code."
	],
	"statement": "In order to exploit this vulnerability, initial access must be gained via an additional vulnerability.\nThe PSP and AEGIS vulnerabilities necessitate a BIOS update, as they are not inherent to the CPU and cannot be addressed through CPU microcode updates. This requires a UEFI firmware update from the device vendor, distinct from updates in the linux-firmware package. Therefore, linux-firmware on Red Hat Enterprise Linux is marked as not affected.",

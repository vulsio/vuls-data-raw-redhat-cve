		"A regular expression based DoS vulnerability in Active Support <6.1.7.1 and <7.0.4.1. A specially crafted string passed to the underscore method can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking. This can cause the process to use large amounts of CPU and memory, leading to a possible DoS vulnerability.",
		"A flaw was found in rubygem-activesupport. RubyGem's activesupport gem is vulnerable to a denial of service caused by a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) flaw in Inflector.underscore. By sending a specially-crafted regex input, a remote attacker can use large amounts of CPU and memory, resulting in a denial of service."

	"cwe": "CWE-400",
	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in the `named` application, part of the bind9 package, which uses a cache database to speeds up DNS queries. To maintain its efficiency when running as a recursive name resolver, `named` performs a cache database clean up under certain conditions. This issue may allow an attacker to craft a continuous set of crafted queries, which can induce `named` to trigger the cleanup process with a high frequency, making the internal cleanup items queue to grow indefinitely. This can lead to an uncontrolled memory consumption and resource starvation, potentially making `named` consume all available memory in the host, leading to a Denial of Service of the targeted system."

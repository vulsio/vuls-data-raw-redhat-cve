	"cwe": "CWE-78",
	"details": [
		"In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or host name.",
		"A flaw was found in OpenSSH. In certain circumstances, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary OS commands by using expansion tokens (e.g., %u, %h) with user names or host names that contain shell metacharacters."
	],
	"statement": "The ability to execute OS commands is dependent on what quoting is present in the user-supplied ssh_config directive. However, it is generally the user's responsibility to validate arguments passed to SSH.",

	"cwe": "CWE-75",
	"details": [
		"A vulnerability in input validation exists in curl <8.0 during communication using the TELNET protocol may allow an attacker to pass on maliciously crafted user name and \"telnet options\" during server negotiation. The lack of proper input scrubbing allows an attacker to send content or perform option negotiation without the application's intent. This vulnerability could be exploited if an application allows user input, thereby enabling attackers to execute arbitrary code on the system."
	],
	"statement": "While this vulnerability exists in Curl, the potential impact is to a different component. The overall impact is limited to the telnet component. On its own this flaw has a limited to negligible effect on integrity of the entire system, therefore it has been rated as having a Low security impact. This is in alignment with upstreamâ€™s impact assessment, their advisory is linked in external references.",

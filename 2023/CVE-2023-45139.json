	"cwe": "CWE-611",
	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in the subsetting module of FontTools, which contains an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability. This flaw allows malicious actors to exploit the parsing of candidate fonts, particularly those with an OT-SVG format that includes an SVG table. Through this vulnerability, attackers can manipulate the system to resolve arbitrary entities, potentially allowing them to include files from the filesystem where FontTools is operating or even initiate web requests from the host system."
	],
	"statement": "Note that the impact is dependent on the environment fontTools is running in. The vulnerability has the most impact on consumers of fontTools who leverage the subsetting utility to subset untrusted OT-SVG fonts where the vulnerability may be exploited to read arbitrary files from the filesystem of the host fonttools is running on.",

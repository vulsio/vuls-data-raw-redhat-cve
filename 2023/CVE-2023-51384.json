	"cwe": "CWE-304",
	"details": [
		"In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints can be incompletely applied. When destination constraints are specified during addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these constraints are only applied to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token returns multiple keys.",
		"A flaw was found in OpenSSH. When specifying destination constraints while adding PKCS#11-hosted private keys, the constraints only apply to the first key even in cases where the token returns multiple keys."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability only applies to instances where destination constraints are defined and multiple keys are returned from a PKCS#11 token. Use of regular private keys, FIDO tokens and unconstrained keys are unaffected.\nThe affected functionality was added only in OpenSSH 8.9, we have earlier version in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8 and 9.",

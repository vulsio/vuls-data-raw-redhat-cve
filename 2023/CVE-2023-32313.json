	"details": [
		"vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with Node's built-in modules. In versions 3.9.17 and lower of vm2 it was possible to get a read-write reference to the node `inspect` method and edit options for `console.log`. As a result a threat actor can edit options for the `console.log` command. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version `3.9.18` of `vm2`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may make the `inspect` method readonly with `vm.readonly(inspect)` after creating a vm.",
		"A flaw was found in the vm2. After making a vm, the inspect method is read-write for console.log, which allows an attacker to edit options for console.log. This issue impacts the integrity by changing the log subsystem."

		"[REJECTED CVE] A memory handling vulnerability was identified in the Linux kernel's watch_queue subsystem. The issue stems from the lack of overflow checks when duplicating a user-space array with memdup_user(). This could allow an attacker to exploit the absence of safeguards, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition."

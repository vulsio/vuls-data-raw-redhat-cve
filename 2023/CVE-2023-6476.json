	"details": [
		"A flaw was found in CRI-O that involves an experimental annotation leading to a container being unconfined. This may allow a pod to specify and get any amount of memory/cpu, circumventing the kubernetes scheduler and potentially resulting in a denial of service in the node."

	"statement": "There are two main factors reduce the severity of this vulnerability to Moderate:\n* A potential attacker must already have valid credentials\n* The OpenShift environment must already be configured to use an experimental feature",

	"details": [
		"D-Bus before 1.15.6 sometimes allows unprivileged users to crash dbus-daemon. If a privileged user with control over the dbus-daemon is using the org.freedesktop.DBus.Monitoring interface to monitor message bus traffic, then an unprivileged user with the ability to connect to the same dbus-daemon can cause a dbus-daemon crash under some circumstances via an unreplyable message. When done on the well-known system bus, this is a denial-of-service vulnerability. The fixed versions are 1.12.28, 1.14.8, and 1.15.6.",
		"An assertion failure vulnerability was found in D-Bus. This issue occurs when a privileged monitoring connection (dbus-monitor, busctl monitor, gdbus monitor, or similar) is active, and a message from the bus driver cannot be delivered to a client connection due to <deny> rules or outgoing message quota. If a privileged user with control over the dbus-daemon is monitoring the message bus traffic using the Monitoring clients like the dbus-monitor or busctl monitor interfaces, then an unprivileged local user with the ability to connect to the same dbus-daemon could send specially crafted request, causing a dbus-daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service under some circumstances."

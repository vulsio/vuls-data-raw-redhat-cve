	"cwe": "CWE-122",
	"details": [
		"A vulnerability was found in the Academy Software Foundation OpenEXR, and requires that a malicious EXR file image is parsed by the target device or environment using OpenEXR. This issue occurs due to a failure in validating the number of scanline samples of a OpenEXR file containing deep scanline data and allows for a read or write primitive based on the provided EXR file attributes, which could be used to read or write memory to a compromised device through an attacker placed EXR image."
	],
	"statement": "The heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability identified in the Academy Software Foundation's OpenEXR image parsing library represents an important security concern due to its potential for severe consequences and wide-reaching impact. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can execute arbitrary code or perform unauthorized read/write operations on affected systems. This ability to manipulate system memory poses a significant risk to data integrity, confidentiality, and system stability. Moreover, the vulnerability's presence in a widely-used image parsing library amplifies its severity. The ability to execute such attacks without user interaction, known as a 0-click attack surface, further amplifies the risk.",

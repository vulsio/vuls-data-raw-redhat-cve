	"cwe": "CWE-834",
	"details": [
		"In Eclipse Parsson before versions 1.1.4 and 1.0.5, Parsing JSON from untrusted sources can lead malicious actors to exploit the fact that the built-in support for parsing numbers with large scale in Java has a number of edge cases where the input text of a number can lead to much larger processing time than one would expect. To mitigate the risk, parsson put in place a size limit for the numbers as well as their scale.",
		"A flaw was found in Eclipse Parsson library when processing untrusted source content. This issue may cause a Denial of Service (DoS) due to built-in support for parsing numbers with a large scale, and some cases where processing a large number may take much more time than expected."
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat rates this as an important impact since one needs to process untrusted and if there is no sanitization a Denial of Service (DoS) may happen.",

		"Jenkins Pipeline: Job Plugin does not escape the display name of the build that caused an earlier build to be aborted, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to set build display names immediately.",
		"A flaw was found in the Jenkins Pipeline: Job Plugin. Affected versions of Jenkins Pipeline: Job Plugin are vulnerable to Cross-site scripting caused by improper validation of user-supplied input. This flaw allows a remote authenticated attacker to inject malicious script into a Web page, which would then be executed in a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site once the page is viewed. The attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."

This issue affects glibc 2.37 and newer.",

This is the only known impact of this issue and this CVE was assigned to track this possibility.\nThe glibc package, as shipped with Red Hat products, is not affected by this vulnerability because this issue was introduced in glibc 2.37, this glibc version is not used by any Red Hat product.",

	"details": [
		"EDK2's Network Package is susceptible to a buffer overflow vulnerability when processing DNS Servers option from a DHCPv6 Advertise message. This\nvulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized \naccess and potentially lead to a loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and/or Availability.",
		"A security weakness was identified in EDK2, the open-source reference implementation of the UEFI specification, revealing a buffer overflow vulnerability. This vulnerability enables an unauthorized attacker within proximity on the network to transmit a specifically crafted DHCPv6 Advertise message. As a consequence, it results in the unauthorized disclosure of information and jeopardizes the availability of the system."
	],
	"statement": "The discovery of a buffer overflow vulnerability in EDK2, the open-source UEFI implementation, is a significant issue due to its potential impact on system security. This flaw allows an attacker to exploit the system's vulnerability through a specially crafted DHCPv6 Advertise message, leading to unauthorized access, information leakage, and potential compromise of system availability.",

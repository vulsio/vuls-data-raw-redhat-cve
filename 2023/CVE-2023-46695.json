		"An issue was discovered in Django 3.2 before 3.2.23, 4.1 before 4.1.13, and 4.2 before 4.2.7. The NFKC normalization is slow on Windows. As a consequence, django.contrib.auth.forms.UsernameField is subject to a potential DoS (denial of service) attack via certain inputs with a very large number of Unicode characters.",
		"A vulnerability was discovered in the Django package, where NFKC normalization could take a significant time. This flaw allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a denial of service by submitting inputs with a large number of Unicode characters."

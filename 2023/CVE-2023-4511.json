		"BT SDP dissector infinite loop in Wireshark 4.0.0 to 4.0.7 and 3.6.0 to 3.6.15 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file",
		"A denial of service vulnerability was found in Wireshark due to an infinite loop in the Bluetooth (BT) SDP dissector. Exploiting this flaw involves injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or enticing a victim to read a corrupted packet trace file, resulting in a crash of the BT SDP dissector. This issue may allow a remote attacker to perform a DoS attack by consuming all available system resources, leading to excessive CPU resource consumption."

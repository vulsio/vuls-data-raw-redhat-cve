		"Resque is a Redis-backed Ruby library for creating background jobs, placing them on multiple queues, and processing them later. The following paths in resque-web have been found to be vulnerable to reflected XSS: \"/failed/?class=<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>\" and \"/queues/><img src=a onerror=alert(document.cookie)>\". This issue has been patched in version 2.2.1.",
		"A cross-site scripting flaw was found in Resque due to improper validation of user-supplied input by the resque-web failed and queues lists. This issue could allow a remote authenticated attacker to use a specially crafted URL to execute script in a victim's web browser within the security context of the hosting website once the URL is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials."

		"Jenkins 2.393 and earlier, LTS 2.375.3 and earlier shows temporary directories related to job workspaces, which allows attackers with Item/Workspace permission to access their contents.",
		"A flaw was found in Jenkins. Jenkins uses temporary directories adjacent to workspace directories, usually with the @tmp name suffix, to store temporary files related to the build. In pipelines, these temporary directories are adjacent to the current working directory when operating in a subdirectory of the automatically allocated workspace. Jenkins-controlled processes, like SCMs, may store credentials in these directories. Affected versions of Jenkins show these temporary directories when viewing job workspaces, which allows attackers with Item/Workspace permission to access their contents."

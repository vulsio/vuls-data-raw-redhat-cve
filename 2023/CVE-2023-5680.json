		"A flaw was found in the bind9 package. This issue may allow an attacker to substantially decrease `named` performance by sending a specific set of queries, forcing the same name to have a large number of ECS records stored. In the worst case scenario, `named` can become unresponsive, leading to a Denial of Service."

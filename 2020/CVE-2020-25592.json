		"In SaltStack Salt through 3002, salt-netapi improperly validates eauth credentials and tokens. A user can bypass authentication and invoke Salt SSH.",

Invalid eauth credentials and tokens are not handled correctly when calling Salt SSH via the salt-api which could allow an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to restricted information or to possibly conduct further attacks. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."

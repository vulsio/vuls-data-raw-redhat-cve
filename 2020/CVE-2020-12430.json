A memory leak was found in the virDomainListGetStats libvirt API that is responsible for retrieving domain statistics when managing QEMU guests. This flaw allows unprivileged users with a read-only connection to cause a memory leak in the domstats command, resulting in a potential denial of service.",

	"statement": "Versions of `libvirt` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are marked as \"notaffected\" because they do not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package. Specifically, the affected function `qemuDomainGetStatsIOThread()` was introduced in `libvirt` upstream version 4.10.0.\nRHEL Advanced Virtualization is affected by this flaw as it ships a more recent version of the package.",

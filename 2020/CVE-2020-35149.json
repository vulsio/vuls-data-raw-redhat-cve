	"cwe": "CWE-94",
	"details": [
		"lib/utils.js in mquery before 3.2.3 allows a pollution attack because a special property (e.g., __proto__) can be copied during a merge or clone operation.",
		"A flaw was found in mquery that allows a prototype pollution attack. This flaw allows an attacker to alter the code behavior by modifying the object prototype. A flaw in the lib/utils.js function allows cloning and merging objects without sanitizing their special properties, such as prototype defining \"__proto__\". The highest threat from this vulnerability is to integrity."
	],
	"statement": "The affected version of mquery is a dependency of the mongoose library. The exploitation of this vulnerability requires authenticated access, consequently, the CVSSv3 score for RHACM is lower than the score of the flaw.",

	"cwe": "CWE-416",
	"details": [
		"GNU Bison before 3.7.1 has a use-after-free in _obstack_free in lib/obstack.c (called from gram_lex) when a '\\0' byte is encountered. NOTE: there is a risk only if Bison is used with untrusted input, and the observed bug happens to cause unsafe behavior with a specific compiler/architecture. The bug report was intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison."
	],
	"statement": "bison as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 does not reproduce this flaw. It properly detects the NULL byte and errors out accordingly instead of causing use-after-free. This is likely due to introduction of vulnerable code in a more recent version of bison.",

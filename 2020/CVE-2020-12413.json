	"details": [
		"The Raccoon attack is a timing attack on DHE ciphersuites inherit in the TLS specification. To mitigate this vulnerability, Firefox disabled support for DHE ciphersuites.",
		"A flaw was found in Mozilla nss. A raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman(DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."
	],
	"statement": "NSS as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 does not re-use Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) keys. It reuses Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (ECDHE) keys by default, but Attacking ECDH and ECDHE cipher suites are not in the scope of the Raccoon Attack and generally considered to be unaffected [1]. Further, reuse of ECDHE keys can be disabled starting in nss 3.17 [2].\nFor these reasons, Red Hat Product Security has marked the Severity of this flaw as Low. Please see [3] for more information about Low Severity ratings.\n1. https://raccoon-attack.com/RacoonAttack.pdf pg. 13\n2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.17_release_notes\n3. https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification",

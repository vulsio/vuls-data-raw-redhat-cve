	"details": [
		"** DISPUTED ** compose.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.22 calls unserialize for the $attachments value, which originates from an HTTP POST request. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because these two conditions for PHP object injection are not satisfied: existence of a PHP magic method (such as __wakeup or __destruct), and any attack-relevant classes must be declared before unserialize is called (or must be autoloaded). .",
		"An unsafe deserialization vulnerability was found in SquirrelMail. This flaw allows an authenticated user to craft malicious form data when submitting mail."

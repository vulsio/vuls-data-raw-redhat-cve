	"details": [
		"It has been found that in openshift-enterprise version 3.11 and openshift-enterprise versions 4.1 up to, including 4.3, multiple containers modify the permissions of /etc/passwd to make them modifiable by users other than root. An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this to modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges. This CVE is specific to the openshift/apb-tools-container.",
		"An insecure modification vulnerability in the /etc/passwd file was found in the openshift/apb-tools. An attacker with access to the container could use this flaw to modify /etc/passwd and escalate their privileges."

	"statement": "By default this vulnerability is not exploitable in un-privilieged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform. This is because the system call SETUID and SETGID is blocked by the default seccomp policy.",

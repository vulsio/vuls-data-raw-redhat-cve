		"Memory leak in Kafka protocol dissector in Wireshark 3.4.0 and 3.2.0 to 3.2.8 allows denial of service via packet injection or crafted capture file.",
		"A flaw was discovered in the Apache Kafka protocol dissector of Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would potentially make Wireshark crash resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."

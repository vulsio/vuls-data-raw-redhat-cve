		"An improper authorization flaw was discovered in openstack-selinux's applied policy where it does not prevent a non-root user in a container from privilege escalation. A non-root attacker in one or more Red Hat OpenStack (RHOSP) containers could send messages to the dbus. With access to the dbus, the attacker could start or stop services, possibly causing a denial of service. Versions before openstack-selinux 0.8.24 are affected.",

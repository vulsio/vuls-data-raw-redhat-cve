		"Use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel exploitable by a local attacker due to reuse of a DCCP socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid object as a listener after being released. Fixed in Ubuntu Linux kernel 5.4.0-51.56, 5.3.0-68.63, 4.15.0-121.123, 4.4.0-193.224, 3.13.0.182.191 and 3.2.0-149.196.",
		"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. When reusing a socket with an attached dccps_hc_tx_ccid as a listener, the socket will be used after being released leading to denial of service (DoS) or a potential code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."

		"value": "Red Hat has previously automatically blacklisted the DCCP module in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 and later in /etc/modprobe.d/dccp-blacklist.conf.\nIf this file does not exist with the above contents, the module can be prevented loading by running the  command\n# echo \"install dccp /bin/true\" >> /etc/modprobe.d/dccp-blacklist.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the DCCP module is loaded. In most circumstances, the DCCP kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any network interfaces are active and the protocol is in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services."

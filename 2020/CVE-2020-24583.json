The `FILE_UPLOAD_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS` mode was not applied to intermediate-level directories created when uploading files or to intermediate-level collected static directories when using the `collectstatic` management command. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality."

While the flawed package is shipped with the below Red Hat products, the flaw cannot be activated without manually updating Python to a newer release. This change would break many features and is an unsupported configuration.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 15 and 16 ship Python 3.6.8; 10 and 13 ship Python 2.X.\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 uses Python 2.X\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 uses Python 2.X",

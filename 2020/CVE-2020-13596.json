	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in Django 2.2 before 2.2.13 and 3.0 before 3.0.7. Query parameters generated by the Django admin ForeignKeyRawIdWidget were not properly URL encoded, leading to a possibility of an XSS attack.",
		"A flaw was found in Django, where the query parameters for the admin widget `ForeignKeyRawIdWidget` were not properly URL encoded. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a Cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
	],
	"statement": "The following products ship the flawed code, however they do not make use of ForeignKeyRawIdWidget and are therefore not vulnerable to this flaw:\n* Red Hat Satellite 6\n* Red Hat Update Infrastructure 3\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, 15, & 16\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3\nThe version of python-django shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage(RHCS) was used with calamari and graphite which are no more supported, hence the django package will not be fixed for RHCS.",

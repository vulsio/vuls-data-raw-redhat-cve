	"details": [
		"In LoadPartitionTable of gpt.cc, there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege when inserting a malicious USB device, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-8.1 Android-9 Android-10 Android-8.0Android ID: A-152874864",
		"An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in gdisks' LoadPartitionTable() function of 'gpt.cc'. The exploitation of this flaw requires the use of a malicious storage device (for example, a USB Stick) that can cause a crash when physically inserted into the system and possible local privilege escalation. This flaw allows an attacker to compromise confidentiality, integrity, and data availability."

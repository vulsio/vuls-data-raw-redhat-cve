	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.4 through 5.7.1. drivers/tty/vt/keyboard.c has an integer overflow if k_ascii is called several times in a row, aka CID-b86dab054059. NOTE: Members in the community argue that the integer overflow does not lead to a security issue in this case.",
		"A flaw integer overflow in the Linux kernel's virtual terminal keyboard driver was found in the way the user sends some specific keyboard code multiple times. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system."
	],
	"statement": "No code depends on this integer overflow so it is unlikely that the vulnerability can be used for anything apart from crashing the system. The impact has been reduced to Moderate from Important based on this analysis.",

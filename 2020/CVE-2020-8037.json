		"The ppp decapsulator in tcpdump 4.9.3 can be convinced to allocate a large amount of memory.",

This flaw allows a remote attacker to send specially crafted packets that, when printed, can lead the application to allocate a large amount of memory, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."

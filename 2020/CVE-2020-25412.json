		"com_line() in command.c in gnuplot 5.4 leads to an out-of-bounds-write from strncpy() that may lead to arbitrary code execution.",
		"A flaw was found in gnuplot. An execution path from com_line() in command.c results in strncpy() being called with an incorrect length, causing an out-of-bounds write. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by passing a specially crafted input file to gnuplot. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."

	"details": [
		"Engine.IO before 4.0.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a POST request to the long polling transport.",
		"An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was found in engine.io. If an attacker crafts a packet with a very large payload length or crafts many small packets, this can cause the engine.io to consume an ever increasing amount of memory and/or CPU, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."

	"statement": "Red Hat Quay uses engine.io as a dependency of karma. Karma and therefore engine.io are only used at build time, and not during runtime, making this vulnerability low impact for Red Hat Quay.",

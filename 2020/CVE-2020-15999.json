	"details": [
		"Heap buffer overflow in Freetype in Google Chrome prior to 86.0.4240.111 allowed a remote attacker to potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.",
		"A heap buffer overflow leading to out-of-bounds write was found in freetype. Memory allocation based on truncated PNG width and height values allows for an out-of-bounds write to occur in application memory when an attacker supplies a specially crafted TTF file."
	],
	"statement": "Although firefox and thunderbird, as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, bundle a version (2.4.11) of freetype in gtk3-private, the version is not affected by this flaw because the vulnerable code was introduced in a subsequent version of freetype. The freetype package shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 is not affected as the vulnerable code was introduced in a subsequent version of freetype.\ngo-freetype as shipped with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes is not affected by this flaw because it ships a pure go implementation of freetype which does not include the vulnerable code.",

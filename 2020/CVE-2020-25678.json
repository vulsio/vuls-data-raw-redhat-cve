Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 is not affected by this flaw, and does not log passwords by default. \n* Red Hat OpenShift Container Storage (RHOCS) 4 shipped Ceph package for the usage of RHOCS 4.2 only, that has reached End Of Life. Hence, the Ceph package is no longer used and supported with the release of RHOCS 4.3.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform deployments use the Ceph package directly from the Ceph channel; the RHOSP package will not be updated at this time.",

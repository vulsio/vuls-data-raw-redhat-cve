		"A flaw was found in Jenkins versions prior to 2.251 and LTS 2.235.3. The remote address of hosts starting a build via 'Trigger builds remotely' are not properly escaped leading to a potential stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission or knowledge of the authentication token. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."

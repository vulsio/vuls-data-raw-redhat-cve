	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and 16.0.0. The EC2 API doesn't have a signature TTL check for AWS Signature V4. An attacker can sniff the Authorization header, and then use it to reissue an OpenStack token an unlimited number of times.",
		"A flaw was found in Keystone, where the restriction was not checked for the Signature Version 4 (V4) process of AWS signatures issued within a limited time window. This flaw allows an attacker to capture an auth header and reuse it, potentially maintaining indefinite access."

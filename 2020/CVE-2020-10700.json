		"A use-after-free flaw was found in the way samba AD DC LDAP servers, handled 'Paged Results' control is combined with the 'ASQ' control. A malicious user in a samba AD could use this flaw to cause denial of service. This issue affects all samba versions before 4.10.15, before 4.11.8 and before 4.12.2."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw does not affect the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux as there is no support for samba as an Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC). Similarly, the version of samba shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 is also not supported for use as an AD DC and, thus, is not affected by this vulnerability.",

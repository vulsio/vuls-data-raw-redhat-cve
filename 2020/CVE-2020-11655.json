		"SQLite through 3.31.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a malformed window-function query because the AggInfo object's initialization is mishandled."
	],
	"statement": "It seems like this issue existed since sqlite-3.25.0, when window function (https://www.sqlite.org/windowfunctions.html)  was added, but it lead to segmentation fault after https://www3.sqlite.org/cgi/src/info/712e47714863a8ed was committed, which could result in denial of service. This commit is a part of sqlite-3.30 release.\nTherefore previous versions are not vulnerable to this flaw.",

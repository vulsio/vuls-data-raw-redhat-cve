	"statement": "Although the squid packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 through 8 are affected, they are compiled with FORTIFY_SOURCE, which in this case limits the impact of the buffer overflow to an application termination. This only affects deployments acting as reverse proxy with a http_port 'accel' or 'vhost' (squid 2.x and 3.x) or http_port 'accel' configuration (squid 4.x).",

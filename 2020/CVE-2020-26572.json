		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "This flaw can be mitigated in cases where you can use opensc without the TCOS driver enabled. In such cases, the vulnerable driver can be disabled by specifying them in /etc/opensc.conf card_drivers field in allowlist fashion.\nOne such example:\n```\napp default {\ncard_drivers = cac, cac1, PIV-II;\n}\n```\nThis would only enable the cac, cac1, and PIV-II smart card drivers, and all others would be disabled, including the TCOS driver. With the TCOS driver disabled, this flaw is mitigated. It is important to list all drivers that you need in the card_drivers field so that they are not disabled too."

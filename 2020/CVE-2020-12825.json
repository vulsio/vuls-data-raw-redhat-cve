	"cwe": "CWE-674->CWE-121",
	"details": [
		"libcroco through 0.6.13 has excessive recursion in cr_parser_parse_any_core in cr-parser.c, leading to stack consumption.",
		"A stack overflow flaw was found in libcroco. A service using libcroco's CSS parser could be crashed by a local, authenticated attacker, or an attacker utilizing social engineering, using a crafted input. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
	],
	"statement": "While Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7 and 8 ship versions of `libcroco` that are vulnerable to this flaw, the packages which use this library as a dependency would require a user to open a malicious file locally for exploitation. Opening such a file may result in a temporary crash of the application.  See below for more detailed information:\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 - `libcroco` is a runtime dependency of `gnome-shell`, `gettext` and `inkscape`.\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 - `libcroco` is a runtime dependency of  `gnome-shell`, `gettext`, `librsvg2` and `inkscape`.\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 - `libcroco` is required by `firefox` to bundle `gtk3` but `firefox` does not use `libcroco` as its CSS parsing engine or provide gtk3 to other packages, and thus not affected. `libcroco` is a runtime dependency of `inkscape`, `librsvg2` and `gettext`.\nThis flaw has only been demonstrated to cause a crash, but if there is any concern of further exploitation beyond that, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 packages are built with a stack protector and stack ASLR which would significantly reduce the likelihood of further exploitation.",

Red Hat Enterprise Linux does not ship with gnome-shell themes that will trigger this vulnerability. To mitigate this flaw as it applies to inkscape, do not open untrusted CSS in inkscape."

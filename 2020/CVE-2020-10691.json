	"details": [
		"An archive traversal flaw was found in all ansible-engine versions 2.9.x prior to 2.9.7, when running ansible-galaxy collection install. When extracting a collection .tar.gz file, the directory is created without sanitizing the filename. An attacker could take advantage to overwrite any file within the system.",

	"statement": "Ansible Engine 2.9.6 as well as previous 2.9.x versions are affected. Ansible versions less than or equal to 2.8 are not affected by this vulnerability as this functionality was introduced on 2.9.\nAnsible Tower 3.6.3 as well as previous 3.6.x versions are affected as they use ansible-galaxy collections.",

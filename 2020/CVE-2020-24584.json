While the flawed package is shipped with the below Red Hat products, the flaw cannot be activated without manually updating Python to a newer release. This change would break many features and is an unsupported configuration.\n* Red Hat OpenStack Platform versions 15 and 16 ship Python 3.6.8; 10 and 13 ship Python 2.X.\n* Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and 3 uses Python 2.X\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 uses Python 2.X",

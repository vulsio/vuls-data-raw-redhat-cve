		"A flaw was found in the way the Ceph RGW Beast front-end handles unexpected disconnects. An authenticated attacker can abuse this flaw by making multiple disconnect attempts resulting in a permanent leak of a socket connection by radosgw. This flaw could lead to a denial of service condition by pile up of CLOSE_WAIT sockets, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources, preventing legitimate users from connecting to the system.",

The version provided in the OpenStack repositories is outdated and customers are expected to be using versions provided in Ceph repositories now. Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 operators should verify they are using Ceph repositories which are up to date and unaffected by this vulnerability.\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is not affected by this flaw, as it ships an old version of the code which does not include the vulnerable code.\n* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is not affected by this flaw, as only libcephfs-devel component is shipped and it does include the vulnerable code.",

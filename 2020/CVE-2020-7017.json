	"statement": "In Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (RHOCP) the affected kibana region map visualization is behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable visualization to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is Low.\nRed Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4 delivers the kibana package where the region map visualization is included, but due to the code changing to the container first content, the kibana package is marked as wontfix. This may be fixed in the future.",

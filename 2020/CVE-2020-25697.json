	"statement": "As per upstream, exploiting this flaw is non-trivial and it requires exact timing on the behalf of the attacker. Many graphical applications exit if their connection to the X server is lost, so a typical desktop session is either impossible or difficult to exploit. There is currently no upstream patch available for this flaw.",

		"In the Linux kernel before 5.5.8, get_raw_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacks validation of an sk_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls.",
		"A stack buffer overflow issue was found in the get_raw_socket() routine of the Host kernel accelerator for virtio net (vhost-net) driver. It could occur while doing an ictol(VHOST_NET_SET_BACKEND) call, and retrieving socket name in a kernel stack variable via get_raw_socket(). A user able to perform ioctl(2) calls on the '/dev/vhost-net' device may use this flaw to crash the kernel resulting in DoS issue."

The fix will be provided from core Ansible. However, we still ship Ansible separately for Ceph Ubuntu.\nIn Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact,  ansible is not directly customer exposed, and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.",

	"details": [
		"A vulnerability was found in upstream release cryptsetup-2.2.0 where, there's a bug in LUKS2 format validation code, that is effectively invoked on every device/image presenting itself as LUKS2 container. The bug is in segments validation code in file 'lib/luks2/luks2_json_metadata.c' in function hdr_validate_segments(struct crypt_device *cd, json_object *hdr_jobj) where the code does not check for possible overflow on memory allocation used for intervals array (see statement \"intervals = malloc(first_backup * sizeof(*intervals));\"). Due to the bug, library can be *tricked* to expect such allocation was successful but for far less memory then originally expected. Later it may read data FROM image crafted by an attacker and actually write such data BEYOND allocated memory.",
		"A flaw was found in the way cryptsetup parses encrypted images with invalid segments. This flaw allows a local attacker to crash an application compiled with cryptsetup, or in some cases, cause arbitrary code execution when parsing specially crafted encrypted images. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw was introduced in upstream release cryptsetup-2.2.0, with the inclusion of the LUKS2 re-encryption code. This feature is not available in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, therefore it is not affected by this flaw.",

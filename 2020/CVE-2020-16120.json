		"Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up files in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user namespace, if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces were allowed. It was possible to have a file not readable by an unprivileged user to be copied to a mountpoint controlled by the user, like a removable device. This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef (\"ovl: stack file ops\"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by commits 56230d9 (\"ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()\"), 48bd024 (\"ovl: switch to mounter creds in readdir\") and 05acefb (\"ovl: check permission to open real file\"). Additionally, commits 130fdbc (\"ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory\") and 292f902 (\"ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()\") in kernel 5.8 might also be desired or necessary. These additional commits introduced a regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces which prevented access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace. This regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da (\"ovl: do not fail because of O_NOATIMEi\") in kernel 5.11.",
		"A flaw was found in the User namespace on an overlay filesystem in the Linux Kernel, Where a file with no access privilege was able to copy the file to a user defined mount point. An attacker with a special user privilege locally may lead to a kernel information leak problem."

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "Red Hat feels this flaw needs a number of conditions in place for the attacker to exploit, and  the mitigation for this issue is to avoid a  target file t existing on an overlay filesystem,  accessible in the namespace, which is  writable by the exploiting target."

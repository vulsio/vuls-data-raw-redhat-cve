	"details": [
		"** DISPUTED ** The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends duplicate responses to the server upon a utimes system call failure, which allows a malicious unprivileged user on the remote server to overwrite arbitrary files in the client's download directory by creating a crafted subdirectory anywhere on the remote server. The victim must use the command scp -rp to download a file hierarchy containing, anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the vendor points out that \"this attack can achieve no more than a hostile peer is already able to achieve within the scp protocol\" and \"utimes does not fail under normal circumstances.\""
	],
	"statement": "Red Hat does not consider this issue as a security flaw. As per upstream:\n\"Exploitation of this is not likely as utimes(2) does not fail under normal circumstances. Successful exploitation is not silent - the output of scp(1) would show transfer errors followed by the actualfile(s) that were received\"\nThis CVE has been rejected by MITRE.",

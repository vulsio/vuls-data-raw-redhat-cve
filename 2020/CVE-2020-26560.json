	"details": [
		"Bluetooth Mesh Provisioning in the Bluetooth Mesh profile 1.0 and 1.0.1 may permit a nearby device, reflecting the authentication evidence from a Provisioner, to complete authentication without possessing the AuthValue, and potentially acquire a NetKey and AppKey.",
		"An impersonation attack vulnerability was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s Bluetooth Mesh Profile implementation. The Mesh Provisioning procedure has a flaw that allows an attacker without knowledge of the AuthValue to spoof a provisioned device and use crafted responses that appear to possess the AuthValue. This issue permits an attacker to be issued a valid NetKey and potentially an AppKey. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."

	"statement": "Red Hat Product Security is aware of this issue and is currently assessing the impact on Red Hat supported products. Corresponding entry in the Red Hat CVE database (https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve) will be updated with latest information as the assessment progresses.",

	],
	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "For this attack to be successful, an attacking device needs to be within the wireless range of a Mesh Provisioner and either spoof the identity of a device being provisioned over the air or be directly provisioned onto a subnet controlled by the provisioner. After successfully authenticating without the AuthValue, the attacker can perform any operation permitted to a node provisioned on the subnet until it is either denied access or a new subnet is formed without the attacking node present."

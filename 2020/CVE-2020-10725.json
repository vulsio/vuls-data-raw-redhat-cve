		"A flaw was found in DPDK version 19.11 and above that allows a malicious guest to cause a segmentation fault of the vhost-user backend application running on the host, which could result in a loss of connectivity for the other guests running on that host. This is caused by a missing validity check of the descriptor address in the function `virtio_dev_rx_batch_packed()`.",

	"statement": "The versions of `dpdk` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 were not affected by this flaw, as they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a later version of the package. This issue did not affect the versions of `ceph` as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 and 4, as they did not include support for dpdk.",

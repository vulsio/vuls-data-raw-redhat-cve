	"details": [
		"The cifs_find_smb_ses function in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 does not properly determine the associations between users and sessions, which allows local users to bypass CIFS share authentication by leveraging a mount of a share by a different user."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of Linux kernel as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, 5, 6, and Red Hat Enterprise MRG as they did not ship mount.cifs with root setuid set. However, as a preventive meaasure, we have addressed this in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1386.html and https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2011-1253.html. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is now in Production 3 of the maintenance life-cycle, https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/, therefore the fix for this issue is not currently planned to be included in the future updates.",

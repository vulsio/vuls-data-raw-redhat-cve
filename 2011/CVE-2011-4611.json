	"statement": "This issue did not affect the Linux kernels as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and 5 as they did not have support for Performance event. It did not affect Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it did not provide support for PowerPC. This has been addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2012-0350.html.",

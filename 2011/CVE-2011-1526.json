On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, the ftpd daemon did not check for the potential failure of the krb5_setegid() function call. On systems where the set real, set effective, or set saved group ID system calls might fail, a remote FTP user could use this flaw to gain unauthorized read or write access to files that were owned by the root group."

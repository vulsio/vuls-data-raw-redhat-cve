	"details": [
		"The dccp_rcv_state_process function in net/dccp/input.c in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 does not properly handle packets for a CLOSED endpoint, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by sending a DCCP-Close packet followed by a DCCP-Reset packet."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 as it did not include support for the DCCP protocol. Future updates in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG may address this flaw.",

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "For users that do not run applications that use DCCP, you can prevent the dccp\nmodule from being loaded by adding the following entry to the end of the\n/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file:\nblacklist dccp\nThis way, the dccp module cannot be loaded accidentally, which may occur if an\napplication that requires DCCP is started. A reboot is not necessary for this\nchange to take effect but do make sure the module is not loaded in the first\nplace. You can verify that by running:\nlsmod | grep dccp\nYou may also consider removing the CAP_SYS_MODULE capability from the current\nglobal capability set to prevent kernel modules from being loaded or unloaded.\nThe CAP_SYS_MODULE has a capability number of 16 (see linux/capability.h). The\ndefault value has all the bits set. To remove this capability, you have to\nclear the 16th bit of the default 32-bit value, e.g. 0xffffff ^ (1 << 16):\necho 0xFFFEFFFF > /proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound"

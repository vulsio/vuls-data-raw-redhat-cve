	"statement": "This issue did affect the versions of kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.\nThis issue did affect the versions of kvm package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Red Hat cannot backport the fix though as it is too invasive and has a high risk of introducing severe regressions at this point in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 life-cycle. As such, Red Hat recommends that users of KVM on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 only use PCI passthrough with trusted guests. \nThis issue did affect the versions of kernel package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of kernel-rt package as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise MRG as it did not provide support for virtualization.\nFor further info please refer to the knowledge base article https://access.redhat.com/knowledge/articles/66747.",

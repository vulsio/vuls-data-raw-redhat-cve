	"details": [
		"The router advertisement daemon (radvd) before 1.8.2 does not properly handle errors in the privsep_init function, which causes the radvd daemon to run as root and has an unspecified impact."
	],
	"statement": "A failure in privsep_init() does not cause radvd to run with full root privileges when invoked with the --username option specifying an unprivileged user.  Rather it will run as a single process as the specified (unprivileged) radvd user, causing this issue to have no security impact (no unintended privilege elevation).",

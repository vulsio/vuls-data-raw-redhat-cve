		"The IRQ setup in Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when using device passthrough and configured to support a large number of CPUs, frees certain memory that may still be intended for use, which allows local guest administrators to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and hypervisor crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to an out-of-memory error that triggers a (1) use-after-free or (2) double free."

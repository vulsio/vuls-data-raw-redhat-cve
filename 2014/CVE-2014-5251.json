	"details": [
		"The MySQL token driver in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2014.1.x before 2014.1.2.1 and Juno before Juno-3 stores timestamps with the incorrect precision, which causes the expiration comparison for tokens to fail and allows remote authenticated users to retain access via an expired token.",
		"It was found that the MySQL token driver did not correctly store token expiration times, which prevented manual token revocation. Only OpenStack Identity setups configured to make use of revocation events were affected."

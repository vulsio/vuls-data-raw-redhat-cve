	"details": [
		"Path traversal vulnerability in Docker before 1.3.3 allows remote attackers to write to arbitrary files and bypass a container protection mechanism via a full pathname in a symlink in an (1) image or (2) build in a Dockerfile.",
		"It was found that a malicious container image could overwrite arbitrary portions of the host file system by including absolute symlinks, potentially leading to privilege escalation."
	],
	"statement": "* This issue affects the versions of Docker as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario. A future update may address this issue.\n* Red Hat does not support or recommend running untrusted images.\n* In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw's impact is low and docker is not directly used by the director-operator, no update will be provided at this time for the operator containers.",

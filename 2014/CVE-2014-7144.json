	"details": [
		"OpenStack keystonemiddleware (formerly python-keystoneclient) 0.x before 0.11.0 and 1.x before 1.2.0 disables certification verification when the \"insecure\" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini) file regardless of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted certificate.",
		"It was found that python-keystoneclient treated all settings in paste.ini files as string types. If the \"insecure\" option were set to any value in a paste.ini configuration file, it would be evaluated as true, resulting in TLS connections being vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks."

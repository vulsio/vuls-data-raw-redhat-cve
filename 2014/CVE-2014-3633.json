		"The qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune function in qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt before 1.2.9, when a disk has been hot-plugged or removed from the live image, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or read sensitive heap information via a crafted blkiotune query, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.",
		"An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in the way libvirt's qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune() function looked up the disk index in a non-persistent (live) disk configuration while a persistent disk configuration was being indexed. A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, leak memory from the libvirtd process."

		"The Nova EC2 API security group implementation in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.1 before 2013.2.4 and icehouse before icehouse-rc2 does not enforce RBAC policies for (1) add_rules, (2) remove_rules, (3) destroy, and other unspecified methods in compute/api.py when using non-default policies, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges via these API requests.",
		"It was found that RBAC policies were not enforced in certain methods of the OpenStack Compute EC2 (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud) API. A remote attacker could use this flaw to escalate their privileges beyond the user group they were originally restricted to. Note that only certain setups using non-default RBAC rules for OpenStack Compute were affected."

	"details": [
		"The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not provide a mechanism for authorizing socket operations based on the opener of a socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and modify network configurations by using a Netlink socket for the (1) stdout or (2) stderr of a setuid program.",
		"It was found that the permission checks performed by the Linux kernel when a netlink message was received were not sufficient. A local, unprivileged user could potentially bypass these restrictions by passing a netlink socket as stdout or stderr to a more privileged process and altering the output of this process."

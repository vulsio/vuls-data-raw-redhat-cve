This has been rated as having Moderate security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates. For additional information, refer to the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle: https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/.\nTo mitigate this issue, you may use the ip6tables command to prevent spoofing of local addresses on any network interface other than the loopback interface.

		"id": "1205079",
		"url": "https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1205079"
	},
	"details": [
		"The Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.19 does not ensure that the visible xattr state is consistent with a requested replacement, which allows local users to bypass intended ACL settings and gain privileges via standard filesystem operations (1) during an xattr-replacement time window, related to a race condition, or (2) after an xattr-replacement attempt that fails because the data does not fit."
	],
	"statement": "This issue does not affect the versions of the kernel package as shipped with\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2.\nThis issue affects the version of Linux kernel as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7. Future kernel updates for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 may address this issue.\nGiven the Moderate impact and the fact that BRTFS file system is no longer Technology preview in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 this issue is not currently planned to be addressed in future releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.",

	"details": [
		"In Artifex Ghostscript through 9.26, ephemeral or transient procedures can allow access to system operators, leading to remote code execution.",
		"It was found that ghostscript could leak sensitive operators on the operand stack when a pseudo-operator pushes a subroutine. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw to escape the -dSAFER protection in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the SAFER constraints."

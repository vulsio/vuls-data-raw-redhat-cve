		"Exim before 4.92.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as root via a trailing backslash.",
		"An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in exim. The function fails to correctly handle situations when a backslash is the last character of the input string and incorrectly sets the pointer that is supposed to point to the last character of the escape sequence upon function exit. That leads to out-of-bounds read when the caller attempts to process the input string following the escape sequence. Additionally, this may lead to out-of-bounds write when unescaped string is written (to the same or different buffer)."

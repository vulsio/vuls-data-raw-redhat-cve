	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "By default, the supported versions of Samba impacted by this issue run using the \"standard\" process model, which is unaffected. This is controlled by the -M or --model parameter to the samba binary. Unsupported Samba versions before Samba 4.7 use a single process for the LDAP server, and so are impacted. Samba 4.8, 4.9, and 4.10 are impacted if -M prefork or -M single is used. To mitigate this issue, select -M standard (the default)."

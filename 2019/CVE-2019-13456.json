	"details": [
		"In FreeRADIUS 3.0 through 3.0.19, on average 1 in every 2048 EAP-pwd handshakes fails because the password element cannot be found within 10 iterations of the hunting and pecking loop. This leaks information that an attacker can use to recover the password of any user. This information leakage is similar to the \"Dragonblood\" attack and CVE-2019-9494.",
		"An information leak was discovered in the implementation of EAP-pwd in freeradius. An attacker could initiate several EAP-pwd handshakes to leak information, which can then be used to recover the user's WiFi password by performing dictionary and brute-force attacks."

	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of freeradius as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, and 6 as they did not include support for EAP-pwd.",

		"In KDE Frameworks KConfig before 5.61.0, malicious desktop files and configuration files lead to code execution with minimal user interaction. This relates to libKF5ConfigCore.so, and the mishandling of .desktop and .directory files, as demonstrated by a shell command on an Icon line in a .desktop file.",
		"A flaw was found in the KDE Frameworks KConfig prior to version 5.61.0. Certain syntax commands were allowed in .desktop, .directory, and configuration files to allow flexible configurations with the desktop environment. An attacker could add malicious code to a file that a user would unintentionally install, thus executing the malicious code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."

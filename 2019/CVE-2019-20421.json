		"In Jp2Image::readMetadata() in jp2image.cpp in Exiv2 0.27.2, an input file can result in an infinite loop and hang, with high CPU consumption. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.",
		"A denial of service vulnerability was found in exiv2 in the way JPEG 2000 (JP2) metadata was read when processing an image file. A remote attacker could abuse this flaw to create a specially crafted image, causing exiv2 to enter into an infinite loop when processing an incoming malicious image."

	"details": [
		"Unbound before 1.9.5 allows an integer overflow in a size calculation in respip/respip.c. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability. Although the code may be vulnerable, a running Unbound installation cannot be remotely or locally exploited",
		"A flaw was found in unbound. An integer overflow in ub_packed_rrset_key function may lead to a buffer overflow of the allocated buffer if the size can be controlled by an attacker. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as service availability."
	],
	"statement": "There is no available reproducer or proof of concept for this issue, nor it was ever proven the integer overflow can lead to a buffer overflow in practice. Indeed in the original report this issue was considered one that might not be triggered and for this reason its Impact is Moderate. Upstream has also disputed this CVE.",

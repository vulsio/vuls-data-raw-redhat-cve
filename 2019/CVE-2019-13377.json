	"cwe": "CWE-200",
	"details": [
		"The implementations of SAE and EAP-pwd in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 2.x through 2.8 are vulnerable to side-channel attacks as a result of observable timing differences and cache access patterns when Brainpool curves are used. An attacker may be able to gain leaked information from a side-channel attack that can be used for full password recovery."
	],
	"statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and 6 as they did not include support for SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) nor for EAP-pwd.\nThis issue did not affect the versions of wpa_supplicant as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8 as they are not compiled with SAE (Simultaneous Authentication of Equals) nor with EAP-pwd enabled. In particular, the CONFIG_SAE=y and CONFIG_EAP_PWD=y options are not set at compile time.",

	"details": [
		"A vulnerability was found in keycloak 7.x, when keycloak is configured with LDAP user federation and StartTLS is used instead of SSL/TLS from the LDAP server (ldaps), in this case user authentication succeeds even if invalid password has entered.",
		"A flaw was found in keycloak 7.x where an invalid password is accepted for user authentication when LDAP user federation and STARTTLS is used instead of SSL/TLS from the LDAP server. This can allow an attacker to log into a system using any entry for a password authentication and still gain access to the system."

	"statement": "This flaw does not affect Red Hat's Single Sign On (RHSSO) product and, thus, no patch will be forthcoming.",

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "Disabling STARTTLS will fix the authentication flaw but leave the connection to the LDAP server unencrypted. Utilizing LDAPS will add a layer of encryption back to the LDAP connection but only at the SSLv3 level which also poses problems in and of itself."

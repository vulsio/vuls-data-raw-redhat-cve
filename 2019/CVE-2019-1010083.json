However, the product is not vulnerable since the data component Crane receives from pulp_docker repository metadata with JSON uses UTF-8 encoding by default. Other supported versions of the Satellite are not affected by this vulnerability.\nNote: CVE-2019-1010083 is a duplicate of the flaw in CVE-2018-1000656. However, the 2019 flaw identifies newer affected products.",

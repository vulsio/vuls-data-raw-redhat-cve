	"statement": "This flaw can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker (PR:N) who could create a specially crafted \"krbPrincipalKey\" and send it to the IPA server (AV:N).  The attack is relatively easy to conduct (AC:L), since all the attacker requires is a string which is long enough to write beyond the limits of the buffer on the stack. User interaction is required for the attack (UI:N). End result in a crash in the IPA server causing denial of service or in some conditions may also result  in remote code execution with the permissions of the user running the IPA server (CIA:H).",

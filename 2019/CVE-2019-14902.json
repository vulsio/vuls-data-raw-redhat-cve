		"There is an issue in all samba 4.11.x versions before 4.11.5, all samba 4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18, where the removal of the right to create or modify a subtree would not automatically be taken away on all domain controllers.",
		"A flaw was found in samba. A newly delegated right, but more importantly the removal of a delegated right, would not be inherited on any DC other than the one where the change was made; the removal would not automatically be taken away on all domain controllers. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity."

	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "Use of 'samba-tool drs replicate $DC1 $DC2 $NC --full-sync' will cause all ACLs to be syncronised from DC2 to DC1, for the given NC (naming\ncontext), eg:\nsamba-tool drs replicate my-DC1 my-DC2 DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync \nsamba-tool drs replicate my-DC1 my-DC2 CN=Configuration,DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync \nsamba-tool drs replicate my-DC2 my-DC1 DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync \nsamba-tool drs replicate my-DC2 my-DC1 CN=Configuration,DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync\nInternally both in patched and un-patched versions, for every object replicated with a --full-sync, the inheritance will be correctly calculated.  This only needs to be done TO each DC, not for each pair-wise pair."

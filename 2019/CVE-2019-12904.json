	"cwe": "CWE-385",
	"details": [
		"In Libgcrypt 1.8.4, the C implementation of AES is vulnerable to a flush-and-reload side-channel attack because physical addresses are available to other processes. (The C implementation is used on platforms where an assembly-language implementation is unavailable.) NOTE: the vendor's position is that the issue report cannot be validated because there is no description of an attack",
		"[Disputed] A vulnerability has been identified in Libgcrypt due to a flaw in its C implementation of AES. This vulnerability enables a remote attacker to perform a flush-and-reload side-channel attack, potentially accessing sensitive information. The vulnerability arises from the availability of physical addresses to other processes, particularly on platforms lacking an assembly-language implementation."

	"statement": "Please note that this issue is more theoretical than practical in terms of potential attack scenarios. The upstream developers have disputed this CVE, and the patches they supplied seem to focus more on hardening. Refer to external references for further details.",

	"details": [
		"Overlayfs in the Linux kernel and shiftfs, a non-upstream patch to the Linux kernel included in the Ubuntu 5.0 and 5.3 kernel series, both replace vma->vm_file in their mmap handlers. On error the original value is not restored, and the reference is put for the file to which vm_file points. On upstream kernels this is not an issue, as no callers dereference vm_file following after call_mmap() returns an error. However, the aufs patchs change mmap_region() to replace the fput() using a local variable with vma_fput(), which will fput() vm_file, leading to a refcount underflow.",
		"A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. In Overlayfs, vma->vm_file was replaced in the mmap handlers and, on errors, the original value is not restored. A local attacker with special user privilege (or root) can cause a kernel internal information leak. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."

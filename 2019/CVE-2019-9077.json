		"An issue was discovered in GNU Binutils 2.32. It is a heap-based buffer overflow in process_mips_specific in readelf.c via a malformed MIPS option section."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability in GNU Binutils is considered moderate in severity because, while it involves a heap-based buffer overflow in the process_mips_specific function, successful exploitation requires the attacker to craft a specific malformed MIPS option section within a binary ELF file. This scenario limits the attack vector to files that the user explicitly processes with readelf, rather than making it exploitable through network services or untrusted inputs.\nMoreover, binutils does not handle privileged operations, meaning exploitation is unlikely to lead to system compromise or escalation of privileges. Additionally, the impact is localized to the application itself, without affecting the broader system or network security.",

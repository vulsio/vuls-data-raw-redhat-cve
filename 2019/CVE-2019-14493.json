	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 4.1.1. There is a NULL pointer dereference in the function cv::XMLParser::parse at modules/core/src/persistence.cpp.",
		"A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in OpenCV in the way the Cascade Classifier algorithm loaded and processed certain classifiers. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a specially crafted XML file that, when loaded by an application linked to OpenCV, would crash the application causing a denial of service."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw did not affect the versions of OpenCV as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 as they did not include the vulnerable code, which was introduced in a newer version of the library.",

	"details": [
		"Envoy 1.9.0 and before does not normalize HTTP URL paths. A remote attacker may craft a relative path, e.g., something/../admin, to bypass access control, e.g., a block on /admin. A backend server could then interpret the non-normalized path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy.",
		"A flaw was found in Envoy version 1.9.0 and older, where Envoy does not normalize HTTP URL paths. This flaw allows a remote attacker to craft a path with a relative path and to bypass access control. This issue results in a backend server with the ability to interpret the unnormalized path."

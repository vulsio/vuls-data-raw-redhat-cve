	"details": [
		"An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.32. There is a heap-based buffer over-read in _bfd_doprnt in bfd.c because elf_object_p in elfcode.h mishandles an e_shstrndx section of type SHT_GROUP by omitting a trailing '\\0' character.",
		"An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Binutils while it processes a malformed ELF relocatable file (.o file). A victim user who uses Binutils tools (size, gdb, readelf) to analyze untrusted binaries, may be vulnerable to a denial of service attack."
	],
	"statement": "Exploitation of this bug specifically requires the victim to analyze a maliciously crafted binary using a tool that uses a vulnerable version of libbfd. No binary under normal circumstances, omits the '\\0' in SHT_GROUP, that is a prerequisite for this attack to work.\nIt is neither common practice, nor recommended to analyze untrusted binaries outside a sandbox. Therefore RH ProdSec has set the Impact of this bug to \"Low\".",

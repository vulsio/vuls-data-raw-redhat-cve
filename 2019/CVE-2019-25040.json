	"details": [
		"** DISPUTED ** Unbound before 1.9.5 allows an infinite loop via a compressed name in dname_pkt_copy. NOTE: The vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability. Although the code may be vulnerable, a running Unbound installation cannot be remotely or locally exploited.",
		"A flaw was found in unbound. An infinite loop in dname_pkt_copy function could be triggered by a remote attacker. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to service availability."
	],
	"statement": "There is no available reproducer or proof of concept for this issue, nor it was ever proven the infinite loop can be triggered in practice. Indeed in the original report this issue was considered one that might not be triggered and for this reason its Impact is Moderate. Upstream has also disputed this CVE.",

		"A flaw was found in Ansible Tower, versions 3.6.x before 3.6.2 and 3.5.x before 3.5.3, where enabling RabbitMQ manager by setting it with '-e rabbitmq_enable_manager=true' exposes the RabbitMQ management interface publicly, as expected. If the default admin user is still active, an attacker could guess the password and gain access to the system.",

	"acknowledgement": "This issue was discovered by Ryan Petrello (Red Hat).",
	"mitigation": {
		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "The issue could be mitigated by limiting the access of the interface to internal trusted networks, limiting the ports open and set the firewall with more restrictive rules. Some of these instructions are already suggested in the Ansible Tower documentation as part of the Ansible Tower Administration Guide. Issue could be also mitigated by deleting the guest default user by running the command \"rabbitmqctl delete_user guest\"."

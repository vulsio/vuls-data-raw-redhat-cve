		"A flaw was found in the way SQLite handled certain types of SQL queries using DISTINCT, OVER and ORDER BY clauses. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a malicious SQL query that, when processed by an application linked to SQLite, would crash the application causing a denial of service."
	],
	"statement": "This flaw has been rated as having a security impact of Low. The versions of `sqlite` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are compiled without SQLITE_DEBUG, so it's not possible to reproduce the crash. The invalid Mem object may still lead to undefined behaviors, though no notable defects have been observed.",

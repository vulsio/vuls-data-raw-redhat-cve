		"The glance-manage db in all versions of HPE Helion Openstack Glance allows deleted image ids to be reassigned, which allows remote authenticated users to cause other users to boot into a modified image without notification of the change.",

		"lang": "en:us",
		"value": "For this flaw to be exploited, both non-admin image upload must be permitted and records of deleted IDs must have been purged from the openstack-glance 'images' database table. \nTo prevent flaw exploitation:\n* Do not allow non-admin users to upload images, or\n* If you do permit normal users to upload images, do not purge the 'images' table. Note: It is safe to delete rows from `image_properties`, `image_tags`, `image_members`, and `image_locations` tables."

		"Apache Karaf prior to 4.0.8 used the LDAPLoginModule to authenticate users to a directory via LDAP. However, it did not encoding usernames properly and hence was vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks leading to a denial of service.",
		"Apache Karaf uses the LDAPLoginModule to authenticate users to a directory via LDAP. It does not, however, encode usernames properly and hence is vulnerable to LDAP injection attacks. While it appears that it is not possible to exploit this vulnerability to allow an attacker to gain remote access, it does allow an attacker to insert special characters into the search query step. Therefore, it can potentially be exploited as part of a Denial of Service attack."

	"details": [
		"An integer overflow in process_bin_sasl_auth function in Memcached, which is responsible for authentication commands of Memcached binary protocol, can be abused to cause heap overflow and lead to remote code execution.",
		"An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was found in memcached's parsing of SASL authentication messages. An attacker could create a specially crafted message that would cause the memcached server to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code."
	],
	"statement": "The version of memcached as shipped with Red Hat OpenStack Platform 9 is affected by this issue however will not be updated. The latest version of memcached from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 can safely be allowed to supersede the earlier versions provided in the Red Hat OpenStack Platform channels.",

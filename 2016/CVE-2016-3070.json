	"details": [
		"The trace_writeback_dirty_page implementation in include/trace/events/writeback.h in the Linux kernel before 4.4 improperly interacts with mm/migrate.c, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a certain page move.",
		"A security flaw was found in the Linux kernel that an attempt to move page mapped by AIO ring buffer to the other node triggers NULL pointer dereference at trace_writeback_dirty_page(), because aio_fs_backing_dev_info.dev is 0."
	],
	"statement": "This issue does not affect the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 as the code with the flaw is not present in the products listed.\nThis issue affects the Linux kernel packages as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and MRG-2. Future updates for the respective releases may address the issue.",

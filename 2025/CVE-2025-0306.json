Do not support PKCS#1v1.5 encryption padding at all.\n* Use Ruby with a version of OpenSSL that has the implicit rejection mechanism implemented.(https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/13817, https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/7fc67e0a33102aa47bbaa56533eeecb98c0450f7 included in 3.2.0, backported to RHEL-8)"

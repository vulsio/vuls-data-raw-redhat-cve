	"details": [
		"Netty, an asynchronous, event-driven network application framework, has a vulnerability starting in version 4.1.91.Final and prior to version 4.1.118.Final. When a special crafted packet is received via SslHandler it doesn't correctly handle validation of such a packet in all cases which can lead to a native crash. Version 4.1.118.Final contains a patch. As workaround its possible to either disable the usage of the native SSLEngine or change the code manually.",
		"A flaw was found in Netty's SslHandler. This vulnerability allows a native crash via a specially crafted packet that bypasses proper validation."
	],
	"statement": "This vulnerability in Netty's SslHandler is of important severity rather than moderate because it directly impacts the stability and reliability of applications using native SSLEngine. By sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker can trigger a native crash, leading to a complete process termination. Unlike typical moderate vulnerabilities that might cause limited disruptions or require specific conditions, this flaw can be exploited remotely to induce a Denial of Service (DoS), affecting high-availability systems and mission-critical services.",
